@4    = ~What do you mean? It's daylight!~
@5    = ~I mean that this pale, white light makes everything seems so cold.~
@6    = ~The shadows are sharper, and there is a strange eeriness about the world.~
@7    = ~You are a poet, Tsujatha. I did not know that.~
@8    = ~What is your night like, then?~
@9    = ~You speak like a mystic, Tsujatha. What is the meaning of night?~
@10   = ~(A soft smile plays on his mouth.) I have never been called a poet before, Lady.~
@11   = ~I have never journeyed with anyone who could appreciate poetry. It is something unexpected in... ~
@12   = ~In a Bhaalspawn? Right. Good-night, Tsujatha.~
@13   = ~In an adventurer? I agree. Most adventurers do not read poetry. That is why I was surprised to find it in you.~

@18   = ~That is beautiful. You mean, do you not, that there is nothing so evil that it does not have a spark of goodness in it?~
@19   = ~Perhaps there is more in both of us than either had expected. I look forward to learning more of you, Lady.~
@20   = ~But for now, it seems best that we go on.  The others will be waiting for us.~

@62   = ~And? Did the city survive? What about the Princess?~
@63   = ~She did not know that she was a Princess, for she was raised to wield the sword.~
@64   = ~She was a warrior without peer. But as for me, my own blood is cursed. She did not know it, nor did I.~

@79   = ~I am sorry to have asked. It is painful for you to speak of such things. Let us talk more later.~

@81   = ~(Tsujatha chuckles slightly, but it is as close to a laugh as you have ever heard from him.)~
@82   = ~I am in my third century. I was placed in a cocoon outside of time to await my father's reincarnation.~

@88   = ~Perhaps they did. I do not know.~
@89   = ~I understand you perfectly.~
@90   = ~(You have been watching Tsujatha for some minutes, and your gaze finally comes to rest on his hands.)~

@93   = ~Tsujatha? Why do you never take your gloves off?~
@94   = ~(The wizard looks at you curiously.) I do take them off.~
@95   = ~(To demonstrate, he pulls his left glove off. His hand is completely unremarkable. His gold skin and well-muscled frame are displayed here as in the rest of his body.)~
@96   = ~You see?~
@97   = ~It was just my imagination then. Sorry to have troubled you.~
@98   = ~What about the other hand?~
@99   = ~(Tsujatha looks away from you.)~
@100  = ~I do not wish to speak of that now. It is enough to say that you are right, <CHARNAME>. That glove I do not remove.~

@106  = ~You are a Bhaalspawn? What *is* a Bhaalspawn? Obviously, the offspring or spawn of Bhaal, but who is Bhaal?~
@107  = ~And what does he have to do with us?~
@108  = ~Bhaal is my father, the dead god of murder.~
@109  = ~Bhaal was the god of murder. He was killed, but before he died he impregnated many women of Faerun. His children are tainted with his blood. I am one of them.~
@110  = ~Ah. I take it that this is not a common occurrence in your world. Otherwise people would not be whispering.~
@111  = ~What does it mean for you to be the child of the god of murder?~
@112  = ~Nothing. I am who I am, regardless of my parentage.~
@113  = ~It means that the lust for death is in my blood. It is something that I must fight every day.~
@114  = ~It means that the shadow of Bhaal hangs over everyone's perception of me. I can never be simply <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep. I must always be the child of Bhaal.~
@115  = ~That is your view? (Tsujatha bites his lower lip.)~
@116  = ~Is it so easy for you to shrug off the divinity in your blood? Is there no struggle for you?~
@117  = ~(His gaze is curiously beseeching.)~
@118  = ~It is always a struggle to do right, regardless of our parentage.  Goodness does not come easily to anyone.  Having an evil god for a father does not absolve me of responsibility for my own actions.~
@119  = ~Yes, it is. I simply refuse to be evil.~
@120  = ~But you do fight it. (It is not a question. Tsujatha seems to be caught up in the wonder of it.)~
@121  = ~I honor you.~
@122  = ~(He watches you for many minutes, but he says nothing more.)~
@123  = ~I do understand this. I am not the child of a god. I am only the son of a wizard so powerful that he lived for nearly 5,000 years.~
@124  = ~He was so hated by the Elves that no one speaks his name, even now, thousands of years after his death.~
@125  = ~I know what it is to be despised for the sake of your name.~
@126  = ~Yes. We are alike in some ways, you and I. (Smile encouragingly at Tsujatha)~
@127  = ~You have no idea. The blood-lust does not course in your veins as it does in mine. It is something I must fight every day.~
@128  = ~I once knew someone who talked as you do, but even she did not have to contend with her own blood.~
@129  = ~(Tsujatha seems to be caught up in the wonder of it.) I honor you.~
@130  = ~You are kind to say so, Lady, but there is more goodness in you than I have ever known. Still, I thank you.~
@131  = ~(He smiles wryly.) That much is obvious. What does he have to do with us?~
@132  = ~You make a poor liar, <CHARNAME>. (He shakes his head.)~
@133  = ~If you do not wish to speak to me, say so. If you do wish it, then tell me what a Bhaalspawn is.~
@134  = ~I do not wish to speak to you, Tsujatha, about such personal matters.  Not now, or ever.~
@135  = ~Very well. I will question you no more.~
@136  = ~You have shared with me what it means for you to be who you are.~ [TSUJA047]
@137  = ~You have been kind to me, and I thank you for it.~
@138  = ~You are welcome, Tsujatha. I appreciate your being in my group. You are quite a powerful mage.~
@139  = ~You are welcome, Tsujatha. And perhaps you be willing to return the favor?~
@140  = ~Not now, Tsujatha.~
@141  = ~Thank you. (The words come slowly off his tongue, and you realize that he is at a loss.)~
@142  = ~(Smile sweetly at Tsujatha) But I would like to know more of you. I have shared with you; now it is your turn.~
@143  = ~What is the matter, Tsujatha?  (You wink at him.) Are you so unused to compliments?~
@144  = ~You would know more of me?~
@145  = ~(His eyes lose their focus, and Tsujatha begins to stare into the middle distance, not looking at you as he speaks.)~
@146  = ~I have never been asked such a question. At least, not when it was not prompted by fear.~
@147  = ~Even Sillara never asked such a thing. But then, perhaps she in particular never would.~
@148  = ~Who was Sillara?~
@149  = ~Then it was the loss of those who would not ask. I know that you are worth knowing. Is there someone you wish would have asked about you?~
@150  = ~(He stops still and turns to look you in the face. His eyes are glowing like silver stars, and he stretches out his hand toward you. He drops it before actually touching you, but his eyes never leave yours.)~
@151  = ~I am indeed unused to them. Even Sillara never said such a thing. But then, perhaps she in particular never would.~
@152  = ~Then it was the fault of their own blindness.  You deserve these words and more.~
@153  = ~Sillara was...is. Why should I think she has ceased to exist when I no longer see her?~
@154  = ~Sillara is a Princess, the Princess with whom I slew a Dragon. She was the companion of my earlier journeys and adventures.~
@155  = ~(His voice is gentle, and he speaks the name of Sillara with reverence.)~
@156  = ~You loved her. Did she return your love?~
@157  = ~What was Sillara to you?  Was she your lover?~
@158  = ~I could have wished that Sillara would have asked, but now I am not so certain.~
@159  = ~(He takes your hand for a moment. His hand is unexpectedly warm, and he squeezes your hand.)~
@160  = ~*You* have asked.~
@161  = ~I have indeed. But who was Sillara?~
@162  = ~I have. Please tell me more of you. (You look down at the hand still holding yours, and you can see on Tsujatha's forearm a long, white scar.) For instance, where did you get that scar?~
@163  = ~You are too kind.~
@164  = ~*You* have asked. That is enough for me.~
@165  = ~Sillara loved me as a brother. She was the Princess who swore the Tamari blood-oath with me.~
@166  = ~(He gestures to the long scar on his forearm.) This is part of the ritual of the oath.~
@167  = ~She loved me enough to do this, but she wed another. *He* was the one whom she truly loved.~
@168  = ~I was always second for her. (Tsujatha's face falls.)~
@169  = ~I am sorry. I can speak no more for the time.~
@170  = ~Sillara was not my lover. She loved me as a brother. She was the Princess who swore the Tamari blood-oath with me.~
@171  = ~I see. It was merely your courtesy and not your kindness.~
@172  = ~Very well. I shall trouble you no more.~
@173  = ~(You have paused in your march, and your gaze is drawn to the well-muscled form of Tsujatha.)~
@174  = ~(He is at this moment, however, sitting with a tired heaviness on his face.)~
@175  = ~(Say nothing and return to your march.)~
@176  = ~You look wearily.~
@177  = ~(Tsujatha sighs and continues, lost in thought.)~
@178  = ~(Tsujatha looks up, and his silver eyes gleam.)~
@179  = ~No, noble mistress: 'tis fresh morning with me when you are by at night.~
@180  = ~You know that poet?~
@181  = ~I told you there was poetry in you, Tsujatha.~
@182  = ~I do. I have been reading whatever poetry of this world that I can.~
@183  = ~I knew that you had a love of poetry in you, Tsujatha.~
@184  = ~Do you know what comes next?~
@185  = ~You once called me a poet, and, though I have no poetry in myself, I do appreciate such things.~
@186  = ~No one has ever seen that before.~
@187  = ~I understand. No one looks for such a thing in a Bhaalspawn, either.~
@188  = ~I do not understand why. There is poetry in the very way you move, Tsujatha.~
@189  = ~(He hesitates a moment, apparently trying to remember. Then, taking a breath, he recites.)~
@190  = ~For several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,
And put it to the foil. But you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best.~
@191  = ~(You sit silent, stunned by the sincerity of Tsujatha's voice.)~
@192  = ~That was beautiful, Tsujatha. Thank you.~
@193  = ~We are more alike than I had ever thought I would see in anyone, let alone someone not even from my own world.~
@194  = ~(Tsujatha suddenly seems to realize that this might be presumptuous, and he backs away from you.)~

@207  = ~Drow?  Oh yes, the dark-skinned Elves. They live below the earth, yes?~
@208  = ~But what of the avariel?~
@209  = ~The avariel are winged Elves who dwell in faraway sky-cities. Their cities are supposed to be lovely, but they are closed to outsiders.~

@218  = ~(Say nothing and continue to look.)~
@219  = ~(Tsujatha looks up at you in surprise.) It is my bracelet.~

@245  = ~Why do you speak in the past tense? What happened? Are you no longer close?~

@277  = ~Yes, I became an adventurer. I, along with...(Tsujatha's voice catches slightly, but he says the name.)~
@278  = ~With Sillara, I took to the road. We sought to discover the reason for the razing of our village.~

@298  = ~(He takes your hand for an instant and raises it to his lips. Just before the kiss reaches fruition, however, he lowers your hand.)~
@299  = ~(You are left confused as you watch Tsujatha spin around and go to the opposite end of the group.)~
@300  = ~(Tsujatha shakes his head.) You are always light-hearted, <CHARNAME>. It is a trait I envy.~
@301  = ~But my question was a serious one. Why did you choose this life?~
@302  = ~Because this road leads to power, and I want more of it.~
@303  = ~I see. That is not the answer I had expected.~
@304  = ~Perhaps I do not know you so well as I had thought.~
@305  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am curious. Please tell me something of your previous adventures.~  [TSUJA069]
@306  = ~I have heard many things, but I do not know the truth.~
@307  = ~I have not been an adventurer for very long. My deeds are not so many.~
@308  = ~I stopped a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate.~
@309  = ~Now is not a good time, Tsujatha.~
@310  = ~But they are many enough that I have heard rumors here, and this is not the place of your origin, obviously.~
@311  = ~No, that is true. I am from the north, a place called Candlekeep. It was in the north that my adventures began.~
@312  = ~True. Earlier I prevented a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate.~
@313  = ~And what were these adventures, <CHARNAME>?~
@314  = ~Your humility makes you reluctant to speak, but I shall force it out of you!~
@315  = ~(He smiles, and there is an unaccustomed happiness on his face.)~
@316  = ~Very well, I give in! (You smile in return.) In the past I prevented a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate.~
@317  = ~It is not my humility, Tsujatha. It is my lack of interest in speaking with you.~
@318  = ~You prevented a war? That is great indeed. How did you do it?~
@319  = ~Sarevok was the man responsible. I fought and killed him.~
@320  = ~I exposed the plot of the man responsible: Sarevok.~
@321  = ~Sarevok? Your brother? You were able to do this?~
@322  = ~Yes. It was not pleasant to have to kill my brother, even a brother by so tenuous a relation. But it was necessary.~
@323  = ~He had killed Gorion. I had to kill him.~
@324  = ~I admire your scruples, but I cannot share them.~
@325  = ~You have told me that this Sarevok slew your foster-father, Gorion. He deserved a slow death.~
@326  = ~Yes, he did kill Gorion. He tried to kill me. I was left with little choice in the matter.~
@327  = ~You are right. I had to kill him.~
@328  = ~I am glad that you were able to honor your father. Your adventures all seem to have done you credit, <CHARNAME>.~
@329  = ~I envy you.~
@330  = ~At least the choice left you led to honor. Your adventures all seem to have done you credit, <CHARNAME>.~
@331  = ~Truthful at least. No more.~
@332  = ~(You have just called a brief halt, and you are refreshing yourself by eating an apple.)~
@333  = ~(You have nearly finished it when you become aware of Tsujatha's eyes resting on you.)~
@334  = ~What is it? Do I have something on my face?~
@335  = ~Did you want some?~
@336  = ~(He chuckles and shakes his head.) No, it is not that.~
@337  = ~It is just that I was thinking of the differences between Gilalion and this world. We have apples, too.~
@338  = ~The very similarities seem to bring the differences into sharper relief.~
@339  = ~What differences?~
@340  = ~For example, though we have apples, and I have seen others eat them, I have never seen anything quite like the way you eat one.~
@341  = ~Is that a good thing?~
@342  = ~What do you mean by that?~
@343  = ~It is a good thing. There is something alien in the very way you move, the way that you swallow.~
@344  = ~To see something so ordinary as an apple being handled in such a way reminds me that I am very far from home.~
@345  = ~Home is where those you love...and who love you...live.~
@346  = ~I hope that you can find a new home here.~
@347  = ~Then I have never had a home before.~
@348  = ~I am sorry. I hope that you can find a new home here.~
@349  = ~That is terrible. But surely you have been loved before?~
@350  = ~(Tsujatha is struck into silence by your words, and he simply stares at you for many moments.)~
@351  = ~(There is an expression akin to fear in his glance, and he watches with the eyes of a man who expects what he sees to vanish into the air.)~
@352  = ~Not in the way necessary to make a home.~
@353  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you miss your old home of Candlekeep?~  [TSUJA083]
@354  = ~Yes, of course I do.  One always misses *home*.~
@355  = ~No. It was my home then, but it is so no longer.~
@356  = ~Do you believe it is possible to create a new home?~
@357  = ~Yes, I believe it is. But I have not yet done so.~
@358  = ~No.  At least, not for me. I can only have one home, and Candlekeep was mine. I can never have another.~
@359  = ~I see. You are consistent, at any rate. You encourage me to find a new home, and you yourself seek one.~
@360  = ~Do you think that you will find the people necessary to make a home?~
@361  = ~Only one person is really necessary. (You smile sweetly at Tsujatha.)~
@362  = ~I have already found some. (You gesture around your group.) These are the ones I will need for my home.~
@363  = ~I am sorry then. You will be a wanderer on this world for the rest of your days?~
@364  = ~I suppose I must.~
@365  = ~I hope not. Perhaps I can find a home after all. The alternative is bleak.~
@366  = ~(Tsujatha blinks. His large eyes soften suddenly as he feels your full meaning.) <CHARNAME>, you are good.~
@367  = ~(There is a sense of regret in his words, and he returns to his place in formation. You see him, however, murmuring your words to himself.)~
@368  = ~You are kind to your traveling companions. Do you think they share your sense of a shared home?~
@369  = ~I do not know. I hope so.~
@370  = ~It only matters if *one* does. (You smile sweetly at Tsujatha.)~
@371  = ~This is too dark an end for you. You have gathered a home around you already.~
@372  = ~These. (He gestures to your group.) These will be your home.~
@373  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. I had not realized it before.~
@374  = ~Only *one* is sufficient for me.(You smile sweetly at Tsujatha.)~
@375  = ~(Tsujatha's gaze rests on you a bit longer, then he resumes his place in the group.)~
@376  = ~I know I have some.~
@377  = ~Then I am glad, Tsujatha. I had not realized it before, but I am already home.~
@378  = ~Only *one* is sufficient for me. (You smile sweetly at Tsujatha.)~
@379  = ~Then if you are without a home, do you seek one?~
@380  = ~Yes, I desire a home, and I am searching for one even now as I adventure.~
@381  = ~No, I cannot build another home. It is not possible for me.~
@382  = ~(You find that you have been watching Tsujatha for the past half hour, watching the even rise and fall of his chest as he sleeps.)~
@383  = ~(It is strange to you that an Elf would sleep as a human does, but Tsujatha has assured you that all Elves of Gilalion do so.)~
@384  = ~(He seems more peaceful asleep than you have ever seen his face when he is awake. Then a spasm of some emotion crosses Tsujatha's face, and he sits up, his chest heaving.)~
@385  = ~(Say nothing and pretend not to notice.)~
@386  = ~Tsujatha? Are you all right?~
@387  = ~Yes, I am...No. You deserve truth from me, <CHARNAME>.~
@388  = ~You have given me naught but truth, and you deserve no less from me.~
@389  = ~I was dreaming of the day I betrayed Sillara.~
@390  = ~What?! I thought you had loved her?~
@391  = ~What do you mean? Why are you afraid?~
@392  = ~Yes, I loved her. I loved her more than my own life, but I was jealous.~
@393  = ~I was too jealous of her betrothed to be true to her. When the time came to destroy the artifact that endangered our people, I did not do so.~
@394  = ~I let her think that I had, but I betrayed her and all the Tamari. Now you know the truth.~
@395  = ~I am a black-hearted traitor like my father before me.~
@396  = ~You are. The sight of you revolts me.~
@397  = ~(Slowly) You have done wrong, it is true, but that does mean you are irredeemable. I have seen your heart, and it is not black.~
@398  = ~But you seem to have repented. You can make amends now, for your deeds seem to grieve you.~
@399  = ~I am afraid because when I sleep I see her eyes of gold as she learns that I have betrayed her and all our people.~
@400  = ~I loved her more than my own life, but I was jealous. I was too jealous of her betrothed to be true to her.~

@402  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes grow dark and large as he listens, but he does not deny your words.)~

@404  = ~I will not inflict myself on you any longer. <CHARNAME>, fare you well.~
@405  = ~You think so?~
@406  = ~(Tsujatha is taken aback by your gentleness, and he moves closer to you to look into your eyes as you reply.)~
@407  = ~Yes, I know that you are not fully evil. There is good in you; it is plain from the fact that your conscience is not dead. Even yet your deeds haunt you, waking you in the night. I have seen goodness in the way that you look at...me.~
@408  = ~Yes, I know it, for you have repented. You can make amends now, for your deeds seem to grieve you.~
@409  = ~You are too kind to me, <CHARNAME>. I am not so good as you think.~
@410  = ~I am sorry for having injured Sillara, for having betrayed her, but the rest of my people...they are not near my conscience.~
@411  = ~It is a start, Tsujatha. More will come in time.~
@412  = ~I was wrong, Tsujatha. You *are* utterly depraved. I cannot bear the sight of you.~
@413  = ~You? Ah, <CHARNAME>, there is more than kindness in your words to me, and there is more than charity in my eyes when I look on you.~
@414  = ~My deeds regarding you are not a just measure of my goodness, for I am not disinterested in what I do.~
@415  = ~Tsujatha, you cannot be utterly evil, or you would not be able to place anyone above yourself. I do think that there is someone you would risk harm to help.~
@416  = ~I cannot be certain. There has already been so much time, and yet I have not changed.~
@417  = ~Still, I thank you for your kindness, sweet <CHARNAME>.~
@418  = ~Perhaps so. (He smiles at you meaningfully.)~
@419  = ~I thank you for your kindness, sweet <CHARNAME>.~
@420  = ~(Tsujatha has been working his way through the marching order for the past quarter of an hour, and he has managed to claim the place beside you.)~

@422  = ~(Wait and say nothing.)~
@423  = ~What is it, Tsujatha?~
@424  = ~You are patient, <CHARNAME>, and I am one who appreciates this quality.~
@425  = ~(He reaches down and takes your hand. It is the first time he has initiated any physical contact with you.)~
@426  = ~You grow bold, Tsujatha.  And this is a quality *I* appreciate.~
@427  = ~Finally! (You laugh softly as you stroke his hand.) I was beginning to wonder if you found me repulsive.~
@428  = ~(An unaccustomed hesitation flickers in Tsujatha's face, but it is instantly gone.)~
@429  = ~(He raises your hand to his lips and kisses it. The kiss is warm and lingering, and he smiles when he has finished.)~
@430  = ~I hope that *this* boldness pleases my Lady.~
@431  = ~It does, Tsujatha.~
@432  = ~I hope that you will grow bolder yet, Tsujatha.~
@433  = ~Good.~
@434  = ~(He strolls away, in no hurry to find his place again.)~
@435  = ~Ah, no, my Lady. You are lovely in my eyes, and you grow ever lovelier the more I see of you.~
@436  = ~And further proof of it I will give you now.~
@437  = ~I hope I have proven myself now to my Lady.~
@438  = ~You have, Tsujatha.~
@439  = ~I hope that you will furnish more proof yet, Tsujatha.~
@440  = ~Perhaps I will.~
@441  = ~(Tsujatha smiles and resumes his place in formation.)~
@442  = ~You are impatient, <CHARNAME>, and I can sympathize with this quality.~
@443  = ~(You have been walking for some time when you realize that Tsujatha is nowhere to be seen. There is a strange quiver in your stomach as you halt the group and call his name.)~
@444  = ~(Relief settles over you as he appears from behind a tree.)~
@445  = ~Tsujatha, where were you?~
@446  = ~What were you doing back there, Tsujatha?~
@447  = ~What do you think you were doing, running off like that?~
@448  = ~I was within sight of you all this time, <CHARNAME>. You had nothing to worry about.~
@449  = ~But what were you doing?~
@450  = ~Never, never do that to me again!~
@451  = ~Do what, <CHARNAME>?~
@452  = ~(Tsujatha has drawn so close to you that you can feel the warmth of his body, but he is not touching you.)~
@453  = ~Make me worry that I had lost you.~
@454  = ~Never mind. What were you doing?~
@455  = ~(Tsujatha's hands cradle your face, and he leans in to kiss you.)~
@456  = ~(His mouth is sweet, and the passion of his kiss is greater than any you have ever known or imagined.)~
@457  = ~(The kiss goes on so long that you begin to lose your breath, but you do not desire his lips to ever leave yours.)~
@458  = ~(At last the kiss ends, however, and Tsujatha is looking down into your eyes.)~
@459  = ~You cannot lose me, <CHARNAME>, except by choice of your own.~
@460  = ~(He backs away from you, and in your hand you find a single white rose.)~
@461  = ~I had found something that I wanted to give you, and I stopped to get it.~
@462  = ~Oh. (You blush.) What was it?~
@463  = ~In that case, you're free to run off any time! So long as you are not gone long.~
@464  = ~This.~
@465  = ~And this. (He backs away from you, and in your hand you find a single white rose.)~
@466  = ~You would not wish me to leave you then, <CHARNAME>?~
@467  = ~Of course not, Tsujatha. I do not want to lose you.~
@468  = ~I want you to remain part of the group, of course, but I think that you may have the wrong idea. I don't want you in any personal way.~
@469  = ~(Tsujatha's face goes white beneath its golden cast, and he turns away from you.)~
@470  = ~(You hear muffled sounds, but he does not turn back to you. He walks off into the distance without looking back at you.)~
@471  = ~(A single white rose is left where he had been standing.)~
@472  = ~You sound worried, <CHARNAME>. Were you concerned that I might have left you?~
@473  = ~Of course I was, Tsujatha! I do not want to lose you, ever!~
@474  = ~Well, maybe a little. (You blush slightly.)~
@475  = ~Not at all. (You wink.) You always come back.~
@476  = ~Only a little? You are a poor liar, <CHARNAME>, as I have told you before.~
@477  = ~(Tsujatha draws so close to you that you can feel the warmth of his body, but he is not touching you.)~
@478  = ~Why did you go?~
@479  = ~Do you want the truth? I never want to you lose you, Tsujatha. That is the truth.~
@480  = ~<CHARNAME>? May I speak to you? (Tsujatha's face is grave, and his voice is heavy.)~  [TSUJA073]
@481  = ~What is wrong, Tsujatha?~
@482  = ~Why does everyone dump his problems on me?~
@483  = ~You seem sad, Tsujatha.~
@484  = ~I wished to speak to you of something of my past, <CHARNAME>.  It concerns...Sillara.~
@485  = ~Ah yes. Your one true love. I would like to hear more about her.~
@486  = ~Sillara? (You shake your head.) It would be too painful for me to listen to anything about her.~
@487  = ~Don't. Please.~
@488  = ~She was...yes, I did love her. I could not help it. She was beautiful.~
@489  = ~Her hair was like honey, and her eyes were as golden as a hawk's.~
@490  = ~She was strong, the greatest warrior in Gilalion since Ellon Tamar himself. She was kind to me.~
@491  = ~She took me in when no one else would. But she did not love me.~
@492  = ~Why not? I cannot understand that.~
@493  = ~How do you know?~
@494  = ~(His glance pierces you as he looks down into your eyes.) Why?~
@495  = ~Because I can't stand to hear about people's problems anymore.~
@496  = ~Because I am jealous, Tsujatha. She was your first love.~
@497  = ~You cannot understand? Why not? How could anyone good love one such as I am?~
@498  = ~Very easily, Tsujatha.~
@499  = ~You are too easily puzzled, Tsujatha.~
@500  = ~I know because she called me brother. She swore the blood-oath with me and made me her brother.~
@501  = ~And she married another. She married Lord Kan-Terak Seranimesti.~
@502  = ~That is the first time in nearly a century that I have spoken that name without cursing it.~
@503  = ~Why did you curse it before?~
@504  = ~Why do you no longer hate him?~
@505  = ~(Tsujatha takes your hands in his for a long moment.) You are too kind, <CHARNAME>.~
@506  = ~But I know that Sillara did not love me. I know because she called me brother.~
@507  = ~She swore the blood-oath with me and made me her brother. And she married another.~
@508  = ~She married Lord Kan-Terak Seranimesti.~
@509  = ~I cursed the name of Seranimesti because he stole Sillara from me. He took her, and she was all that I had.~
@510  = ~But I no longer hate him, nor do I envy him. Sillara he can keep. I have found another love.~
@511  = ~I have found <CHARNAME>.~
@512  = ~I no longer hate Lord Kan-Terak, nor do I envy him. Sillara he can keep. I have found another love.~
@513  = ~You can be assured that *my* problems at least you shall never hear again.~
@514  = ~(Raw fury is in his face, but his eyes are utterly dead.)~
@515  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I am not sad. I merely had something I wished to speak to you of. It concerns...Sillara.~
@516  = ~(Tsujatha has been watching you throughout the day, and now, as you begin to make camp, his eyes are on you again.)~
@517  = ~(You sense his desire to speak to you, and you draw him aside. Despite his evident gratitude, it takes Tsujatha a full minute to begin to speak.)~
@518  = ~(You wait patiently, utterly at a loss as to what he wishes to say.)~
@519  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is a question I would ask of you, but I do not know how to begin.~
@520  = ~(Seeing Tsujatha at a loss is a new experience for you, and you are puzzled in turn. For lack of anything better to do, you continue to wait silently.)~
@521  = ~It is all right, Tsujatha. You may ask me anything you wish.~
@522  = ~Then perhaps you should wait until you are ready.~
@523  = ~(He seems to gather courage from your eyes, and he speaks at last.)~
@524  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you ever had a lover?~
@525  = ~No, Tsujatha. I have not. There was not much opportunity for such a thing in Candlekeep, and I have been on the road since then. An adventurer's life is difficult, and it is not easy to ask someone to share it.~
@526  = ~(Blushing) No, Tsujatha. I have never been in love before, so I have never had reason to take a lover.~
@527  = ~Yes, Tsujatha, I have. My first was a boy from Candlekeep, one of the village boys, named Simon. He was good-looking, and we were young. What more reason did we need? After Simon I have had lovers here and there, but never anyone who was important to me.~
@528  = ~Yes, Tsujatha, I have. I have had several, in fact. Does that bother you?~
@529  = ~You have not had a lover before? Someone so vibrant, so intense as you?~
@530  = ~(He smiles, and you see relief in his eyes.)~
@531  = ~Why do you ask?~
@532  = ~Have *you* ever had a lover?~
@533  = ~Why are you relieved?~
@534  = ~Never before? Or not now? (Your eyes are glowing, and he smiles. You catch a glimpse of relief on his face.)~
@535  = ~Why did you ask me such a question?~
@536  = ~(Tsujatha's brow furrows, and on his face there is a look which you cannot decipher.)~
@537  = ~So making love means nothing to you? The only requirements are youth and beauty?~
@538  = ~There is nothing more than this in the joining of two bodies and souls?~
@539  = ~Well, it's a lot of fun! Why limit it when both parties are agreeable? But when there is the opportunity for more, for a deeper bond, then that *does* mean something.~
@540  = ~It doesn't mean much, I admit. It's fun, but that is about it. Love is an unrelated thing, you know. It has no bearing on sex.~
@541  = ~It means much to me. But I have only made love, as you call it, a few times. The rest of the time it was simply sex.~
@542  = ~It does, I confess. The thought that other men have possessed your body is not something that I can think of with equanimity.~
@543  = ~That you have loved other men is also not something I can bear to think.~
@544  = ~I have dreamt of a love, but I have dreamt of one whole and for me alone.~
@545  = ~My past is past, Tsujatha. What I have done before I met you means nothing. How was I to know that I would ever meet you?~
@546  = ~You are jealous, Tsujatha. Will you ever be able to forget this?~
@547  = ~I did not love them. I have never been in love before.~
@548  = ~Because I...needed to know. I have myself never taken a lover.~
@549  = ~I had ample opportunity, for I was a Prince and a hero.~
@550  = ~(There is still bitterness in his voice when he speaks of his former high station, but he goes on quickly.)~
@551  = ~I loved one woman, and her I could not have. It would not have been right to make love to another.~
@552  = ~I understand. (You smile at him, and he relaxes.) I am glad you told me this, Tsujatha.~
@553  = ~You are right. Sex without love is worse than meaningless, and I am glad that we neither of us have had it. Perhaps someday we will have the chance to experience both together.~
@554  = ~As am I.~
@555  = ~(Tsujatha seems aware of your double-entendre, and he flushes as he goes to his bedroll.)~
@556  = ~No. I have myself never taken a lover. I had ample opportunity, for I was a Prince and a hero.~
@557  = ~Because I am jealous, you know. I have myself never taken a lover.~
@558  = ~I see. Perhaps then we are not so different. Sex I have had often, but a lover, one whom I loved, never.~
@559  = ~I loved only one woman, and she wed another. (There is still darkness in Tsujatha's eyes, despite his words.)~
@560  = ~What is the matter, Tsujatha? Why are you sad?~
@561  = ~Are you jealous, Tsujatha?~
@562  = ~I once thought as you, <CHARNAME>, but I have learned otherwise.~
@563  = ~Love and sex are connected, no matter how we may try to divide them.~
@564  = ~It is a difficult lesson, for once learned it requires that you give up one unless you have the other.~
@565  = ~Then it's a lesson I don't want to learn, and I don't appreciate your being so self-righteous. I'm glad we had this talk, so now I can tell you to bugger off.~
@566  = ~Then maybe you could teach me.~
@567  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes harden as you speak, and he turns on his heel.)~
@568  = ~It was perhaps foolish for me to hope such a thing.  Yet when I look into your eyes I can believe that your soul, your heart, is still yours to bestow.~
@569  = ~You have not loved another, and this is enough for me.~
@570  = ~My heart is not mine to give; a tall Elf with midnight hair has already stolen it.~
@571  = ~I am jealous, too, Tsujatha. What of *you*? Have you ever had lovers?~
@572  = ~(Understanding shines in his eyes, and he kisses your hand.)~
@573  = ~I do not know. Was it merely sex for you? Or did you love these others?~
@574  = ~I have never been in love before.~
@575  = ~Yes, I have been in love before, but it was nothing like what I feel now. My heart now is utterly lost. I have never felt this way before.~
@576  = ~It was more than mere sex. It was love. I would not sleep with a man I did not love. I suppose that is not what you wished to hear, but I do not wish to lie to you.~
@577  = ~I am not sad. I am sobered by the realization that dreams are never perfect. But sometimes they are close.~
@578  = ~(He smiles down into your eyes, and he leans forward to kiss you.) Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for being honest with me.~
@579  = ~I... (Tsujatha breaks off suddenly. He does not speak again that evening, and he retires to his bedroll soon after.)~
@580  = ~You are correct. I *am* jealous. I freely admit it. I hate the thought of sharing even your past.~
@581  = ~Yet that is unjust, for I have loved before. It was the bliss of requited love I have never known...until now.~
@582  = ~(Tsujatha smiles suddenly, a brilliant smiles that lights up his whole face.) Ah, <CHARNAME>, you know always just what words my heart requires for solace.~
@583  = ~I hope to be able to teach you this. And very soon.~
@584  = ~(He leans forward to kiss you. He does not speak again that evening, and he retires to his bedroll soon after.)~

@590  = ~I do not claim to understand you, Tsujatha. Only to love you.~

@597  = ~(You smile gently.) Is it so hard to believe, my love? But do you love me as well?~
@598  = ~Yes, love unrequited, the source of the most exquisite sufferings.~
@599  = ~(He stops walking and takes your hands. His clasp is icy, and he seems to hold onto you as for life.)~
@600  = ~Is it to be my fate yet again to have my love unmatched?~
@601  = ~(You disengage your hands.) Yes, Tsujatha, I am afraid it is. I fear that you and I can never be more to each than mere companions.~
@602  = ~No, Tsujatha. I love you.~
@603  = ~(You draw Tsujatha's hands to your heart.)This beats for you alone, Tsujatha. My love is yours.~

@624  = ~You have surely seen in my eyes that I desire a fuller union with you. Would you give yourself to me?~
@625  = ~With all my heart, Tsujatha. I want to share this experience with you. My heart is already yours. Take my body, too.~
@626  = ~Yes, Tsujatha. I have been wanting you for so long! Lie with me. Let us take our fill of love until the dawn.~

@631  = ~(His searching kiss begins to move down from your lips, passing onto your neck. You find your back arching in your pleasure as the pressure of his lips on your throat increases.)~
@632  = ~(You moan softly as he gently unlaces your gown. The feel of his hands on your breasts intensifies your desire, and you feel your skirts grow wet.)~
@633  = ~(His lips move down to your breasts, and the stimulation causes you to cry out in delight.)~
@634  = ~(His hands move farther down, and you realize that you are totally unclothed now.)~

@637  = ~(Tsujatha lies on top of you, and his lips are locked with yours.)~

@639  = ~(How long Tsujatha makes love to you, you could not have said. Countless times you have arched your back and cried aloud as the increased wetness in your privates has testified to your climax.)~

@644  = ~(There is a hint of disappointment in his eyes, but it is displaced almost at once by understanding.)~

@651  = ~Would you give yourself to me?~
@652  = ~(Tsujatha shakes his head slightly.) Morning would be a most difficult time to ask this.~
@653  = ~I do not think that I could do it without the mask of night to give me courage.~
@654  = ~(He takes a deep breath, and his next words come in a sudden rush.) My beloved, my desire cannot be a secret from you.~
@655  = ~(There is a hint of disappointment in his eyes.) You would refuse me?~
@656  = ~You have given yourself to others, but you refuse me? Perhaps I was wrong.~
@657  = ~Wrong about what, Tsujatha?~
@658  = ~Tsujatha, please understand. It because I love you as I have never loved anyone that I want our love to remain pure. I do not want to enjoy your body until...I have the proper rights to it.~
@659  = ~Perhaps I was wrong about your feeling for me. Or is it that you have learned the value of love-making?~
@660  = ~I do not want to sleep with you to prove my love. If that is the case, then *you* do not love *me*.~

@662  = ~(Understanding lights his face, and Tsujatha smiles.) Of course, my dearest.~
@663  = ~I should not have asked this of you. You are right, and I was selfish. Forgive me, and let us think of it no more.~
@664  = ~(Horror appears in a silver flash of Tsujatha's eyes.) No, my love. Not that!~
@665  = ~It was not my intention to make your surrender to me a condition of proving your love!~
@666  = ~(He looks down as he draws in a ragged breath.) It was simply that I doubted because you have already shared yourself with others.~
@667  = ~If with them, some of whom you have admitted you did not love, why not with me, whom you claim to care for?~
@668  = ~I have changed since I met you, Tsujatha. If I had the choice to make again, I would not have slept with anyone. I want to wait until the time is right, until we can truly make love without causing a stain on our honor.~
@669  = ~I have changed my mind, Tsujatha. I *do* want to make love to you. Now.~
@670  = ~I just don't feel like it, Tsujatha. I was wrong about my feelings for you. I thought I loved you, but I find I do not. And I cannot have sex with you without loving you. You deserve better than that.~

@672  = ~(He bows stiffly before you and then walks away. You watch until he vanishes into the distance, and you know that you will never see him again.)~

@688  = ~Tsujatha? (Lay your hand on his arm)~
@689  = ~What is the matter?~
@690  = ~Irenicus? That blackguard?~
@691  = ~(Tsujatha turns back to face you. He grips your arms tightly, and a fierce light burns in his eyes.)~

@693  = ~That he should have ever had you in his power to do *that* to you is...is wrong!~
@694  = ~There are no gods in this world worth worshipping if they can allow this to happen to you!~
@695  = ~But I am half a god myself, Tsujatha. The others are not allowed to intervene.~
@696  = ~I am not so important as all that, Tsujatha. Everywhere innocents are harmed by the wicked. Free will is necessary, or else all our lives are mere mockery anyway.~

@715  = ~If you do not wish to speak of it, that is all right.~
@716  = ~I do not wish to remind you of pain. Let it go.~

@728  = ~<CHARNAME>.~
@729  = ~I do not know what it means. Perhaps it is a reminder of the scars in my soul. Perhaps it is a sign of the inescapable evil of my blood.~
@730  = ~(He shrugs painfully.) As I said, I do not know.~
@731  = ~I think it is your heart, cut by the deed you had to perform.~
@732  = ~I do not know either, but this much I can tell you. You are not wholly evil. There is love in your heart, and there is therefore goodness.~
@733  = ~There is nothing to forgive, sweet one. Love does not keep secrets. (He leans down to kiss your nose.)~
@734  = ~I am glad that you know.~
@735  = ~It was much against my will to kill him, but it was the best deed laid to my account.~
@736  = ~I have never done anything less selfish. (Unconsciously, Tsujatha squares his shoulders.)~

@763  = ~His house left the Silbrios, unable to endure their shame. They and their city, Mirmanduil, the city of the Forsaken, were eventually destroyed by one of the Dragons.~

@842  = ~After looking into your eyes, the very flames seem dark.~
@843  = ~You have a silver tongue, Tsujatha. (Smile at him.)~
@844  = ~(Wink at Tsujatha.) Then should I turn my eyes away from you? ~
@845  = ~You are mistaken there, Lady-love. It is not my poetry that infuses my words; it is the theme, Lady <CHARNAME>.~
@846  = ~But come, sit beside me, and let me whisper to you all that the firelight on your face will tell.~
@847  = ~What does the firelight say?~
@848  = ~I do not want to hear the words of the fire. I want to hear the words of Tsujatha Melalor.~
@849  = ~No, indeed, my Lady. Stay and blind me with your light.~
@850  = ~I would rather spend my days in darkness at your side than to live in the shadows that throng wherever you are not.~
@851  = ~You are a true poet, Tsujatha.~
@852  = ~(Lean down and kiss Tsujatha.)~
@853  = ~The firelight says that it would be ashamed to glow in your presence, for the brightness of your eyes shames it.~
@854  = ~It can only go on in the hope that its warmth can do you ease.~
@855  = ~(Pull on Tsujatha's hand.) It is time for bed, my poet.~
@856  = ~The words of Tsujatha Melalor are simply these. I vow to serve my Lady <CHARNAME> until I have drawn my last breath.~
@857  = ~It is she who lights my way, and without her I dwell in the uttermost darkness.~
@858  = ~That was beautiful, Tsujatha.~
@859  = ~(Tsujatha returns your kiss with sweetness, and you sit down by his side before the fire.)~
@860  = ~(Neither of you stirs, and you pass the night sitting side by side with your fingers interlocked.)~
@861  = ~(Tsujatha pulls you down beside him, and you surrender to his clasp. You take your place next to him, and neither of you stirs again.)~
@862  = ~(You pass the night sitting side by side with your head on his shoulder.)~
@863  = ~Not so beautiful as the theme, beloved.~
@864  = ~No, I cannot, not from this fire. These flames are too busy speaking of Lady <CHARNAME> to tell the future.~
@865  = ~And what does the firelight say?~
@866  = ~(Tsujatha looks up at you and smiles.) Then take your place.~
@867  = ~(Sit next to him.) My place is here, by your side.~
@868  = ~But you are sitting in it!~
@869  = ~(You have touched Tsujatha with your words, and he slips his arm around you in silence.)~
@870  = ~(You lean your head against him, and neither of you stirs again. You pass the night sitting side by side with your head on his shoulder.)~
@871  = ~And why should that stop you? (Tsujatha laughs softly and pulls you down into his lap.)~
@872  = ~(You surrender to his clasp and nestle into his arms. Neither of you stirs again, and you pass the night enfolded his arms with your head against his heart.)~
@873  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes have been resting on you for some time before he speaks.) What does your name mean, <CHARNAME>?~ [TSUJA062]
@874  = ~It means strong and free.~
@875  = ~It means sweet and fair.~
@876  = ~I would have thought that was obvious. Gorion had a warped sense of humor.~
@877  = ~I would have thought that was obvious. Gorion had no imagination.~
@878  = ~It suits you, my love. You are both strong and free. Nothing, not even the god's blood in your veins, can sway you.~
@879  = ~You are as you choose to be. (There is admiration mixed with the love in his voice.)~
@880  = ~My own name means Gryphon.~
@881  = ~Gryphon? Why were you called that?~
@882  = ~Who gave you that name?~
@883  = ~I was called so because my father wished me to be the Miralyn...the King of Magic.~
@884  = ~In my world lions are the symbol of Kings and eagles of magicians. A gryphon, both lion and eagle, would be both King and magician.~
@885  = ~Your father was right in one thing. You *are* the King of Magic. (You lean up and kiss his cheek.) You are a mighty magician, and you are the King of my heart.~
@886  = ~You are also strong my love. You, too, have defied your blood. You did not become what your father wished you to be.~
@887  = ~My father did. He wished me to be the Miralyn...the King of Magic.~
@888  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your heart is the only kingdom I would wish for.~
@889  = ~No, I did not. I have become something far better...the beloved of <CHARNAME>.~
@890  = ~That is the summit of my ambition now. (He leans down and kisses you softly.)~
@891  = ~(Tsujatha smiles.) I envy you that. (He does not explain his envy but goes on.)~
@892  = ~It suits you, beloved. You are both sweet and fair. Nothing, not even the god's blood in your veins, can corrupt you.~
@893  = ~You are as you were meant to be. (There is admiration mixed with the love in his voice.)~
@894  = ~(Tsujatha smiles wryly.) I suppose you are right. My own name is similar for my people.~
@895  = ~The meaning is obvious: Gryphon.~
@896  = ~(You overhear Tsujatha murmuring something in his native tongue, and it strikes you afresh that he is not of this world.)~
@897  = ~(He feels your look and smiles at you.) What is it, <CHARNAME>?~
@898  = ~Nothing, Tsujatha.~
@899  = ~Do you ever think of Gilalion?~
@900  = ~Don't ever leave me, Tsujatha.~
@901  = ~You are a terrible liar, my love. It is a good trait. What is it that troubles you, little one?~
@902  = ~Nothing now. (You kiss his lips.) I have you.~
@903  = ~Do you ever think of your homeworld?~
@904  = ~And so you always shall.~
@905  = ~So that is the difficulty. I do think of it sometimes, Lady-love, but I have no intention of returning there.~
@906  = ~Unless, of course, you wanted to see it.~
@907  = ~I think I would like that, Tsujatha. Perhaps someday we could go there together.~
@908  = ~I do not want you to go back there, Tsujatha. I am glad you are here...with me.~
@909  = ~I, too, would like that. It would give me joy to show to you the beauties of my homeworld.~
@910  = ~I, too, am glad.~
@911  = ~Leave you? Why do you say such a thing?~
@912  = ~Because you are not of this world, and I fear that you would one day wish to return to your own.~
@913  = ~Never mind why. Please just say that you will not go.~
@914  = ~I will not leave you, <CHARNAME>, unless you send me away.~
@915  = ~<CHARNAME>, why have you graced me with your love?~  [TSUJA054]
@916  = ~Ummm...what are you talking about?~
@917  = ~Tsujatha, I love you because I have seen your heart.~
@918  = ~(Lean up and kiss Tsujatha.)~
@919  = ~(Tsujatha's voice is curiously raw.) What is it that you see in me that you have bestowed your love on one so unworthy?~
@920  = ~You are not unworthy, Tsujatha. You are strong, valiant, and you have been good to me.~
@921  = ~Why do *you* love *me*?~
@922  = ~I have been good to you?~
@923  = ~<CHARNAME>, my heart is black, but I have not yet fallen so far that I am capable of injuring such excellence as yours.~
@924  = ~It is not to my credit that I have been good to you. It is your own goodness that reflects from me.~
@925  = ~You think too highly of me, Tsujatha. I am not so good as that.~
@926  = ~Then it is enough for me. What I see in you, Tsujatha, I love.~
@927  = ~How could anyone *not* love you? Your goodness shines forth like a star. All must be drawn to its light.~
@928  = ~I know that I am. (Tsujatha takes your hand and raises it to his lips.)~
@929  = ~You are the only light I need.~
@930  = ~But you are. Your goodness shines forth like a star. All must be drawn to its light. I know that I am.~
@931  = ~(Tsujatha takes your hand and raises it to his lips.) You are the only light I need.~
@932  = ~You are all goodness and sweetness, and you dazzle my eyes as you have enchanted my heart.~
@933  = ~My heart? But it is black with hatred and vengeance. How could you love that?~
@934  = ~You are strong and brave, Tsujatha, and you have been good to me.~
@935  = ~You are not perfect, Tsujatha, but neither am I. I am not so good as you think me.~
@936  = ~(You find yourself wishing to hear Tsujatha's voice, and, as if he had read your thoughts, Tsujatha speaks.)~
@937  = ~Would you wish to live always in Amn, <CHARNAME>?~ [TSUJA053]
@938  = ~What? What brought this on?~
@939  = ~In Amn? Never. I hate cities, and Athkatla is particularly bad.~
@940  = ~Yes, I think I could settle in Amn. What about you?~
@941  = ~I was curious about what sort of future you see for...yourself.~
@942  = ~(The last word is said hurriedly, as though Tsujatha had changed his mind at the last moment.)~
@943  = ~You mean what sort of future I see for us?~
@944  = ~Hmm. I don't think I would settle in Amn. I hate cities.~
@945  = ~Yes, Amn would be lovely. What do you think?~
@946  = ~(Tsujatha's face flushes ever-so-slightly.) *Do* you see a future for us?~
@947  = ~I do. I do not know where I may go, or what may befall me, but I do know that I want to be with you, whatever comes.~
@948  = ~I do not know. I cannot see the future. I know that at this moment I want you by my side, but beyond this I cannot go.~
@949  = ~I am glad, beloved. You have made me happier than I can say.~
@950  = ~(The words are simple, but the kiss Tsujatha gives with them assures you of his sincerity.)~
@951  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but...it is not enough. Forgive me, but having known your love, I could not bear to lose it.~
@952  = ~As your love does not match mine, I shall leave now. Better now than later, when I have grown ever less able to bear your absence.~
@953  = ~Fare you well, <CHARNAME> of my heart. May you find the love you desire, and may you remember Tsujatha of the House of Melalor with more pleasure than pain.~
@954  = ~It does not matter to me where I would dwell, so long as it was by your side.~
@955  = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, do you see me in your future?~
@956  = ~The Riose Sar is mine once more. I have retrieved that for which I came into this world.~ [TSUJA065]
@957  = ~My task here is done. I will leave you now, <CHARNAME>.~
@958  = ~(He looks at you for a moment, and he hesitates.)~
@959  = ~No, we have gone too far together for us to part so easily now. I will remain with you until *your* task is done.~
@960  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. Let's go.~
@961  = ~You do not have to do that, Tsujatha. If you want to go home, I will understand.~
@962  = ~No. You should go.~
@963  = ~Yes.~
@964  = ~(Tsujatha shrugs slightly.)~
@965  = ~ This ring was all I had of a home. I will stay with you.~
@966  = ~So it has come to this? Very well.~
@967  = ~I have now retrieved that for which I came into this world.~  [TSUJA078]
@968  = ~I ought, perhaps, to go, to return to the Planes and someday to Gilalion.~
@969  = ~(Tsujatha glances at you, and he smiles.) But I have found something else here that seems to be worth my staying for.~
@970  = ~I am glad of that, Tsujatha.~
@971  = ~(Wink at Tsujatha.) I think you have.~
@972  = ~As am I, <CHARNAME>.~
@973  = ~(Tsujatha smiles at you and returns to his accustomed place in formation.~
@974  = ~I have done it at last! The Riose Sar is mine again. It was for this that I came to Faerun.~  [TSUJA075]
@975  = ~(There is triumph in his tone, and a sudden chill strikes your spine at the realization that there is nothing left to hold Tsujatha on Toril.)~
@976  = ~(As though he read your thought on your face, Tsujatha turns to you and takes your hand.)~
@977  = ~My love, there is no need for that fear. My life is yours, and I will spend it at your side.~
@978  = ~(Kiss Tsujatha.) Thank you, beloved.~
@979  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes seem to burn with a silver passion, and he kisses your mouth but says nothing.)~
@980  = ~There is nothing to thank me for. You are my light, and without you there is nothing for me, not even life.~
@981  = ~You are a great warrior, <CHARNAME>.~   [TSUJA050]
@982  = ~Oh, I realize that you have yet much to learn; I have known my world's greatest warrior, the greatest warrior of her age...or of any age excepting only Ellon Tamar's.~
@983  = ~But you are far from the pinnacle of your prowess. You have much potential.~
@984  = ~For a wizard, you certainly seem to know a lot about fighting.~
@985  = ~Thank you. I think.~
@986  = ~(Tsujatha understands your unspoken question and answers it.)~
@987  = ~I come of a race of warriors. Even if I have not chosen the path of the sword myself, I do recognize good fighting when I see it.~
@988  = ~And, as I said, I was once the companion of a mighty warrior, Princess of our nation of warriors.~
@989  = ~My words were indeed meant as a compliment to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@990  = ~You have an inborn gift for battle that is unlike anything I have seen in my journeys across the Planes.~
@991  = ~You will one day become such a warrior as Faerun is not like to see again.~
@992  = ~You have chosen the path of body discipline and mental training, <CHARNAME>. Why?~  [TSUJA048]
@993  = ~It seemed like a good idea at the time. Besides, I like to work out.~
@994  = ~It is the proper path for one like me, one who must always be disciplined or I will lose myself to the taint within my soul.~
@995  = ~It's none of your business, mageling.~
@996  = ~You enjoy laughter, <CHARNAME>. It is a trait I envy.~
@997  = ~(Tsujatha grows grave, and he does not speak again.)~
@998  = ~You are wise, <CHARNAME>, wise and responsible. It is good to know this about you.~
@999  = ~Our dealings will go smoothly, for I will know what to expect.~
@1000 = ~Do not use such words with me, <CHARNAME>. I do not ask kindness, but common courtesy is necessary among companions.~
@1001 = ~Henceforth, you shall see me no more.~
@1002 = ~What made you choose to study magic, <CHARNAME>?~  [TSUJA058]
@1003 = ~It is a gift in my blood. It would have been irresponsible to let it go to waste.~
@1004 = ~It was the most efficient use of my abilities. I had the gift of magic in my blood, and not to use it would have been to let my best chance of power slip away.~
@1005 = ~Magic is in my blood, and it seemed better than learning to milk cows.~
@1006 = ~I see. In Gilalion, too, magic is in the blood.~
@1007 = ~Indeed, without the magic in my blood in the first place, I could never have learned to cast spells at all.~
@1008 = ~Perhaps my methods are not so different from yours as those of your Faerun wizards are.~
@1009 = ~It will be interesting to see.~
@1010 = ~Power is what matters then. It is good to know this; I will know what to expect from you.~
@1011 = ~You are light-hearted always, <CHARNAME>. But I understand the idea of magic in the blood.~
@1012 = ~In Gilalion, too, magic is in the blood. Indeed, without the magic in my blood in the first place, I could never have learned to cast spells at all.~
@1013 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what is it like to live your life in devotion to righteousness and honor?~ [TSUJA066]
@1014 = ~Do you find the dictates of honor restricting?~
@1015 = ~Yes, I do, but they provide me with guidelines. They show me always what I ought to do, and I need never live with doubt.~
@1016 = ~No, I do not. I became a paladin because that is the way that my heart lies. In following the dictates of honor, the guidelines of my order, I am living my life as I would have chosen to live it.~
@1017 = ~I see. Your heart is kept safe and your character upright by the principles you have sworn to uphold.~
@1018 = ~It is a good way to live.~
@1019 = ~(Tsujatha pauses for a moment, and there is a hint of something unidentifiable in his voice as he speaks again.)~
@1020 = ~But it is, obviously, not for me.~
@1021 = ~I understand. You were born a paladin, and the natural course of your life-stream flows in that path.~
@1022 = ~I could almost envy you.~
@1023 = ~What is it that drew you to protect nature with your sword, rather than with the spells of a druid?~ [TSUJA060]
@1024 = ~I'm better with the sword!~
@1025 = ~I love nature, but I do not seek to preserve the balance as a druid does. I desire goodness.~
@1026 = ~Stow it, wizard.~
@1027 = ~There is much to be said for the recognition of your own talents. You do well, <CHARNAME>, to heed your own natural bent.~
@1028 = ~I admire this in you.~
@1029 = ~You seek goodness as you protect nature. It is a straight path, if not always clear.~
@1030 = ~It is good to live in such harmony.~
@1031 = ~You are a wizard also. Why did you choose to walk this path?~ [TSUJA049]
@1032 = ~I don't really know. Why did *you*?~
@1033 = ~Because I desire the power that magic can bring. I want power; I need it.~
@1034 = ~Magic was the means by which I could do the most good.~
@1035 = ~Because I like magic. It has always interested me, ever since I was a child.~
@1036 = ~Cautious? Or unthinking? Regardless, I shall answer you.~
@1037 = ~I became a mage because it was my fate and destiny to do so.~
@1038 = ~I was the son of the greatest necromancer my world has ever seen, and he had planned me for his future vessel of incarnation. He failed in that.~
@1039 = ~(Tsujatha's face darkens, but he goes on.) The gift of magic pulsed in my blood so strongly that I *had* to learn to shape it.~
@1040 = ~Otherwise, I think I should have gone mad. (Tsujatha breaks off suddenly, and you cannot renew the conversation.)~
@1041 = ~Are you really so simple? I am disappointed, <CHARNAME>. I had hoped there was more to you than this.~
@1042 = ~You aim for goodness then? It is a high mark and one often missed.~
@1043 = ~Is it better to aim and fail, or not to try, <CHARNAME>?~
@1044 = ~It is better to aim for goodness regardless of your success.~
@1045 = ~Goodness must be *achieved,* or you might as well not have tried. Good intentions do not excuse evil acts.~
@1046 = ~It is a naive answer, <CHARNAME>, but one which shows your innocence.~
@1047 = ~You are wiser than I had expected, <CHARNAME>.~
@1048 = ~Such innocence as your first answer showed is not often coupled with such wisdom. You are a worthy leader.~
@1049 = ~That is an enviable situation, <CHARNAME>.~
@1050 = ~That you were able to choose your own path is remarkable, for the opportunity to study magic is not given to everyone.~
@1051 = ~You must have had a happy childhood.~
@1052 = ~(Tsujatha seems unwilling to converse further, and you do not know why.)~
@1053 = ~I have heard your song, <CHARNAME>, and I find that it is imbued with magical qualities.~ [TSUJA079]
@1054 = ~You have made song your study then? Or is it merely that you prefer to cast your spells through song?~
@1055 = ~I am not a spell-singer, or anything of that sort. I am a bard.~
@1056 = ~I am a bard, Tsujatha, not some Elven-style enchanter.~
@1057 = ~I do study song, but I also dabble in magic and in...ahem...a bit of the more stealthy arts.~
@1058 = ~I do not understand. A bard?  A singer of warrior-songs? One who encourages soldiers in battle?~
@1059 = ~Yes, that is it exactly. I do a bit of fighting on the side, but mostly I use my song to encourage my allies.~
@1060 = ~What is there to understand? Or do you not have bards amongst your people?~
@1061 = ~So you are a warrior-poet. They are not common amongst the Tamari. My nation...~
@1062 = ~(Tsujatha breaks off inexplicably.) The Tamari tend to have no need of warrior-poets.~
@1063 = ~They are warriors merely, and they live for battle. However, amongst the Larenai there are more of them.~
@1064 = ~Well, that was educational. I always like to hear a bunch of meaningless names. Thanks.~
@1065 = ~Tamari? Larenai? What does that mean?~
@1066 = ~I see. So you have no bards like me. You are in for a treat adventuring with me!~
@1067 = ~We do have warrior-poets, if that is what you mean. They are not common amongst the Tamari. My nation...~
@1068 = ~Your words are sharp, <CHARNAME>, but I ought to have attended more to my speech.~
@1069 = ~You will not hear such meaningless words again.~
@1070 = ~I still forget, even after all this time, that these names are unknown outside my world.~
@1071 = ~Tamari means the Savage Ones; they are the Elves of the Dylak Thana, the nation where I was born.~
@1072 = ~The Larenai are the Fair Ones, the origin of the Tamari and a much larger nation. But enough of my homeworld.~
@1073 = ~(Tsujatha sets his jaw obstinately, and you at once realize there is no use in speaking of this further.)~
@1074 = ~(Tsujatha shakes his head slightly.) I envy you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1075 = ~(He says nothing of the source of his envy, and his usually grave expression darkens further.)~
@1076 = ~Why? Why do you not devote yourself to one art or the other, to music or to magic? And why bother with thievery?~
@1077 = ~A magician has no need of such rude methods.~
@1078 = ~I study both music and magic because I *like* both. I do not want to have to choose between them. There is so much to enjoy in both that I would not give up either one. And as for so-called thievery, well, it is useful from time to time.~
@1079 = ~You know what? You're right. What was I thinking? (Your voice drips with sarcasm.) How could I ever have imagined I should do something like study *everything* I enjoy? Stupid me.~
@1080 = ~There is so much to see and do in the world, and I want to have it all. I want to see everything, learn everything, do everything. Why limit myself?~
@1081 = ~You still believe it is possible to have everything? <CHARNAME>, despite being an adventurer, you are still extremely naive.~
@1082 = ~(There is an overtone of regret in Tsujatha's voice, and he speaks no more.)~
@1083 = ~I was not discourteous to you. Why should you be so to me? Kindness is not necessary, but amongst companions, courtesy is.~
@1084 = ~Farewell.~
@1085 = ~Have you ever heard the old cliche, jack-of-all-trades, master of none?~
@1086 = ~Still, you do get to enjoy everything you do, and that is good.~
@1087 = ~What are you, <CHARNAME>?~ [TSUJA063]
@1088 = ~I am <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@1089 = ~I am a chinchilla, of course.~
@1090 = ~(Tsujatha waves your answer aside.) No, not *who* are you, *what* are you? what is it that you *do*?~
@1091 = ~I am a thief.~
@1092 = ~I take from the rich and give to the poor.~
@1093 = ~I am an adventurer. Why do you ask?~
@1094 = ~I see. (Tsujatha is rather taken aback.) Why? Why do you walk this path?~
@1095 = ~The path of the thief is not usually the path of honor.~
@1096 = ~Not usually, but I use my talents to aid those in need. I would never steal from one who needed it.~
@1097 = ~What care I for honor?~
@1098 = ~And why should I care?~
@1099 = ~I see. So you claim honor then? The path of the thief is not usually the path of honor.~
@1100 = ~I have seen you engaging in what looks like the employments of a thief. But surely I have been mistaken.~
@1101 = ~You are not a thief, are you?~
@1102 = ~Yes, I am a thief.~
@1103 = ~I would not consider myself a *thief*. I use my talents for goodness.~
@1104 = ~You have your own codes then, and you follow them. I think I understand.~
@1105 = ~(Tsujatha seems satisfied with this and questions you no more.)~
@1106 = ~So you are amoral then. Or immoral. It matters not which.~
@1107 = ~I understand your kind, and I will know how to view our dealings in future.~
@1108 = ~(After this you notice that Tsujatha's eyes are on you more often, and that their glance is calculating.)~
@1109 = ~I am your companion, and it behooves me to know my leader well. Your answer has made it clear enough.~
@1110 = ~I mean, what is that you *do*?~
@1111 = ~(Tsujatha smiles, but his eyes are untouched by amusement.) You are merry, <CHARNAME>.~
@1112 = ~My question, however, was a serious one. I want...I need to know what it is that you *do*.~
@1113 = ~You are a priest, <CHARNAME>, but I am not certain of whom. Whom do you serve?~  [TSUJA056]
@1114 = ~I am a priest of Lathander.~
@1115 = ~I serve no god in particular, but I honor all good gods.~
@1116 = ~I am sorry, Tsujatha. I have no wish to discuss this with you just now. You know nothing of the ways of Faerun, and now is not the best time to teach you.~
@1117 = ~Tell me more of this Lathandar you serve, <CHARNAME>. What are his attributes? What is his dominion?~
@1118 = ~I serve Lathandar, he who is god of the light and the dawn. He is merciful and kind, and I hope to be able to share his grace with others.~
@1119 = ~Yes, my god is Lathandar, the Morninglord. He is known for his grace and his mercy. He called me into his service, and I am honored by his call.~
@1120 = ~It is a high calling, <CHARNAME>, and I honor your choice.~
@1121 = ~But mercy can be dangerous when your enemies will show none. Be wary.~
@1122 = ~You are fortunate indeed to have been called in such a way.~
@1123 = ~(There is envy in Tsujatha's voice, and he does not resume the conversation.)~
@1124 = ~Courteous, if private and close-mouthed. As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@1125 = ~That is an unusual path to follow, is it not? Do you not find a need to focus more on one deity? Who grants you your power?~
@1126 = ~It is not so unusual as you would think. There are many who follow this path.~
@1127 = ~You certainly ask many questions! But, no, I feel no need to focus on one god. Lathandar, Torm, Sune, Corellon, they are all good.~
@1128 = ~I suppose Lathandar grants to me my power, but I have never thought of it before.~
@1129 = ~I see. (Tsujatha's silver eyes flash brightly for a moment.) Who grants to you your power?~
@1130 = ~I suppose Lathandar does, but I have not thought about it much.~
@1131 = ~I do not know. Perhaps Lathandar, perhaps Corellon Larethian, perhaps Sune. It could be any...or all...of the good gods.~
@1132 = ~So all the gods are equal in your eyes, so long as they are good. Consistent, at any rate.~
@1133 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your time. You have given me much to think of.~
@1134 = ~Then do you not owe more allegiance to Lathandar than to the rest? It might bear considering, <CHARNAME>.~
@1135 = ~(Tsujatha does not seem inclined to speak more, and there is a thoughtful glance in his eyes.~
@1136 = ~I am a priest of Helm.~
@1137 = ~I serve no god in particular, but I honor all gods who seek and preserve the balance.~
@1138 = ~Who is Helm? And why is he called the Watcher?~
@1139 = ~Helm is the god I serve. He is called the Watcher because he sees all. He is honorable and impartial, and justice is his purview.~
@1140 = ~Helm is the Ever-seeing, the god of justice and judgment. I am one of his priests, as you must have known to ask me these questions.~
@1141 = ~Ah, a god for the intrepid. Only one not fearful of judgment could serve such a god.~
@1142 = ~You are courageous indeed, <CHARNAME>.~
@1143 = ~I did, for I have overheard your invocations of his name. What I did not know was that justice was his dominion.~
@1144 = ~You are brave, <CHARNAME>, to serve him.~
@1145 = ~So it is the balance that you truly worship? Is this *balance* that grants to you your power?~
@1146 = ~I seek the balance, for it is the essence of perfection. I do not worship it, for it has no personhood.~
@1147 = ~I suppose it is Helm that grants to me my power, but it could be another.~
@1148 = ~I understand, though I do not agree. You are, perhaps, more alien on this world than I had expected.~
@1149 = ~Then it is to Helm, and not to the balance that you ought to pay homage.~
@1150 = ~(Tsujatha shrugs.) But it is no concern of mine.~
@1151 = ~I serve Talos, of course!~
@1152 = ~I serve no god but myself.~
@1153 = ~Oh shut up! I will have none of your nonsense!~
@1154 = ~I have heard a little of this Talos you serve, <CHARNAME>.~
@1155 = ~Why did you choose such a capricious and cruel deity to follow?~
@1156 = ~Talos rewards strength. I have strength and want more. Why else?~
@1157 = ~Talos is the appropriate god for one also capricious and cruel. Why would I worship some foolish god like Lathandar or stuck-up one like Helm? Talos for me!~
@1158 = ~Why not? At least then he will not spend his caprice and cruelty on me.~
@1159 = ~An answer simple and straightforward, as you are. We shall get on well.~
@1160 = ~I know how to deal with those like you.~
@1161 = ~And like your god you revel in your nature. You are a dangerous ally, <CHARNAME>.~
@1162 = ~There is no guarantee of that, at least from what I have heard. Still, it is interesting to note the value of your own hide has with you.~
@1163 = ~You will make a safe ally, one who can always be depended upon to stay out of harm's way.~
@1164 = ~That is a certain religion, if a cold and lonely one.~
@1165 = ~We understand each other now, <CHARNAME>.~
@1166 = ~I thank you for the enlightenment. I shall know how to behave in your group.~
@1167 = ~And I will have none of yours.~
@1168 = ~(Tsujatha speaks calmly, but there is a gleam in his eyes that strikes you.)~
@1169 = ~(Tsujatha turns his back on you and walks away.)~
@1170 = ~Is it not difficult, <CHARNAME>, for you to be a druid?~  [TSUJA051]
@1171 = ~You are a being of such power that it is unlikely *any* action of yours can preserve the balance.~
@1172 = ~There is more to being a druid than preserving balance. There is also preserving nature. I can do that, regardless of my heritage.~
@1173 = ~That is true, but my heart lies with nature. I can guard and protect that, no matter what I am.~
@1174 = ~I can try, can I not? Why must I always be judged by my blood and not myself?~
@1175 = ~You speak truly. Nature can be defiled or upheld without regard to the balance.~
@1176 = ~You make a fine guardian, for your power is...or could become...immense.~
@1177 = ~(Tsujatha's brow furrows.) I apologize, <CHARNAME>. I meant nothing other than a comment on your power.~
@1178 = ~You have the seeds of greatness within you. I meant no reflection on your heritage or blood.~
@1179 = ~(He is silent thereafter, and more than once you feel his eyes resting on you with a peculiar sympathy.)~
@1180 = ~You say that you once had wings? That all your race has them?~
@1181 = ~Y-yes.  They were beautiful. They allowed me to soar through the air like a bird!~
@1182 = ~It was only by them that I was able to take my place among my people.~
@1183 = ~But you are a magician. Why do you continue to beweep the loss of your wings when you can fly without them?~
@1184 = ~You can n-never understand! You have not been robbed of that which makes you what you are! You-you-~
@1185 = ~I do know the loss of more than wings. I lost my very name. (Tsujatha snorts.) You do not know of what you speak.~
@1186 = ~You think that your suffering is the greatest that anyone has ever known. Ha. There are countless losses greater.~
@1187 = ~I lost my sister and my nation. What is the loss of wings to that?~
@1188 = ~You are a cruel, cruel Elf!~
@1189 = ~At least I am not weak.~
@1190 = ~Tsujatha, where did you get that scar?~
@1191 = ~What scar?~
@1192 = ~The one at your neck.~
@1193 = ~Ah, that one. (A silver gleam appears in Tsujatha's eyes, and he opens the top of his tunic.)~
@1194 = ~(The scar, a cruel, jagged thing, snakes down from the hollow of his throat, down his chest all the way to his navel.)~
@1195 = ~That is horrible!~
@1196 = ~Isn't it? (Tsujatha's tone is flippant.)~
@1197 = ~How can you speak of it so l-lightly? That must have been terrible!.~
@1198 = ~Some of us do not fear the scars of our past.~
@1199 = ~Y-you mean that for me, don't you?~
@1200 = ~Of course I do. Who else among us is bowed down by the weight of scars?~
@1201 = ~That was not...not necessary! I meant you no harm!~
@1202 = ~You cannot harm me. You lack the wit.~
@1203 = ~Aerie, I have noticed you often seek the attention of men. Why is this?~
@1204 = ~I do not! I am not a drow slut! I-I just wonder...~
@1205 = ~You wonder if men still find you desirable.~
@1206 = ~I do not wonder. They do not. They cannot. Not with these hideous stumps on my shoulders.~
@1207 = ~It is not the scars, Aerie, that causes men to turn away from you. It is the whining.~
@1208 = ~Why are you so cruel to me?~
@1209 = ~The truth can be painful, little wingless dove.~
@1210 = ~At least I have not fallen into evil!~
@1211 = ~That much is true.~
@1212 = ~You speak of your father as an evil man.~
@1213 = ~He is. He ruined my mother's life, and he has done his best to ruin mine. Even now he leeches my sister's life away.~
@1214 = ~She ought by rights to be married by now.  The very thought of what he has done heats my blood with wrath!~
@1215 = ~I know well that pain and that fury. If you hold it to you, you will grow weak. Instead, you must let it go.~
@1216 = ~How can I let it go? How can I forget what he has done?~
@1217 = ~There is no way to forget.~
@1218 = ~You must find something else, something so important to you that all the past means nothing in comparison.~
@1219 = ~Did you find such a thing?~
@1220 = ~I did.~
@1221 = ~What was it?~
@1222 = ~Something I cannot speak of even now.~
@1223 = ~Tsujatha, tell me more of what it was that gave you strength to leave behind the pain of your past.~
@1224 = ~I have told you that it is not something I can speak of, even now after many years.~
@1225 = ~Tsujatha.~
@1226 = ~Very well. (He is responding more kindly to Anomen than you would have expected, and you see no venom in his face as he continues.)~
@1227 = ~I grew to love a woman. She was kind to me; she gave me the first disinterested kindness I had ever known.~
@1228 = ~What was her name?~
@1229 = ~Fair Star. She was the Fair Star of her people and the shining light of my life.~
@1230 = ~And it was her love that gave you strength?~
@1231 = ~Not exactly. She loved another.~
@1232 = ~I...~
@1233 = ~It is enough.~
@1234 = ~What is it that I see in your eyes, Tsujatha? Why do you watch me when I speak of Moira?~
@1235 = ~Because I have had a sort of sister, and I failed her.~
@1236 = ~Do you think that I have failed Moira? What more could I do? She will not leave our father.~
@1237 = ~Then kill your father.~
@1238 = ~You do not mean that!~
@1239 = ~Do I not? Then you do not know me. I killed *my* father for my Fair Star's sake.~
@1240 = ~You are a druid, Cernd? If I understand correctly, the druids seek to preserve nature in her unspoiled state. Is that not so?~
@1241 = ~It is, Elf. We strive to keep the balance in nature. I myself, in my grove, have...~
@1242 = ~Your grove?~
@1243 = ~Yes, my grove.~
@1244 = ~It is the place that I have sworn to protect, the place where my heart lies hidden...~
@1245 = ~...as a squirrel hides its nuts in the tree that is its home.~
@1246 = ~And why are you not now in your grove?~
@1247 = ~Because, like a wandering...~
@1248 = ~Stop. No similies. Just answer the question.~
@1249 = ~Because the balance of nature required that I journey to discover the source of the druidic upheavals.~
@1250 = ~And then you joined with <CHARNAME> and left nature to rack and ruin?~
@1251 = ~No, no! My heart is still tethered to my grove! I journey with <CHARNAME> to preserve the balance.~
@1252 = ~The balance of your grove?~
@1253 = ~No. I mean, yes. The balance of my grove is a part of the balance of nature...~
@1254 = ~Enough. Let the silence of nature claim YOU, and spare us your pointless speech.~
@1255 = ~You become a werewolf, Cernd. Is not lycanthropy an unnatural state?~
@1256 = ~But I have learned to control it. I am not subject to the vagaries of the moon. My shapeshifting...~
@1257 = ~You avoid the question. Is it not unnatural to be a lycanthrope?~
@1258 = ~There are true lycanthropes, born of lycanthropic parents.~
@1259 = ~And are you one of them?~
@1260 = ~No, but...~
@1261 = ~So you are an unnatural aberration.~
@1262 = ~No! I am a servant of nature.~
@1263 = ~As a wild vine is grafted into a cultivated one, to the betterment of both, so I have had lycanthropy grafted into me, that I might better serve nature.~
@1264 = ~You agree with that?~
@1265 = ~I would have thought that you would, as a druid, have held that cultivation does not improve nature, even if you permit it for the sake of providing food.~
@1266 = ~I am not an aberration! You cannot twist my words into that!~
@1267 = ~But you uphold the ideals of cultivated "improvements" to nature;~
@1268 = ~you have been voluntarily infected with a magical curse;~
@1269 = ~and yet you claim to be a druid serving unspoiled nature.~
@1270 = ~You do not need me to twist your words. You are sufficiently twisted in mind already.~
@1271 = ~Tsujatha, I at last understand why, like a dammed up stream, I am always stymied by you.~
@1272 = ~Astonish me.~
@1273 = ~(Ignoring Tsujatha's acidic response, Cernd goes on.) It is because you are not part of this nature!~
@1274 = ~You do not belong to Faerun. That is why I am always blocked by you when we speak.~
@1275 = ~That is why I cannot get the better of your arguments. YOU are unnatural.~
@1276 = ~Indeed. I should have thought it was because your behavior is inconsistent with your claimed beliefs.~
@1277 = ~That and your own natural stupidity.~
@1278 = ~I know what I am, and I know what I do, even if I cannot explain it to you.~
@1279 = ~And you expect me to take this on trust?~
@1280 = ~Why should I believe that?~
@1281 = ~I do not care if you do.~
@1282 = ~That is well.~
@1283 = ~You are a mage, then, Edwin?~
@1284 = ~Of course I am.~
@1285 = ~(The overgrown creature scarce has the wit of a toad if he does not recognize the red robes of Thay!)~
@1286 = ~My ears are keen, arrogant one. I am new to this world, but I am NOT new to magic.~
@1287 = ~Then perhaps you can tell me what you specialize in.~
@1288 = ~(Tsujatha seems to ignore the question.) I have noticed that your own spells tend toward the summoning.~
@1289 = ~A conjuror, I would hazard.~
@1290 = ~You are correct.~
@1291 = ~*The simian must have peeked at my spellbook!*~
@1292 = ~The "simian" can correctly place you as an conjuror, yet you do not recognize me for a necromancer.~
@1293 = ~(Tsujatha's smile is derisive.)~
@1294 = ~I recognized your spells, hedge-wizard. It was merely your race that puzzled me.~
@1295 = ~Elves cannot be necromancers.~
@1296 = ~(A measure of grudging respect flashes in Tsujatha's eyes.)~
@1297 = ~The limitations of Faerun are not necessarily found elsewhere.~
@1298 = ~Where did you learn magic, Tsujatha? (There is a conciliatory note in Edwin's voice that is rarely heard there, and your attention is immediately drawn.) (It would be best to make peace.  He could be useful.)~
@1299 = ~I had no teacher, if that is what you mean. (Tsujatha gives no sign of having heard Edwin's whispered remarks.)~
@1300 = ~No tutor? Then what was your method?~
@1301 = ~I taught myself from the books of lore that my father had left me.~
@1302 = ~So your father is also a magician.~
@1303 = ~In Gilalion, magic runs in families. Yes, he was.~
@1304 = ~Was?~
@1305 = ~He is dead.~
@1306 = ~(There is a smirk of satisfaction on Edwin's face as he turns away from Tsujatha.)~
@1307 = ~(Doubtless he died in some magical mishap.)~
@1308 = ~Actually, I killed him.~
@1309 = ~(The Thayvian wizard pretends not to have heard.)~
@1310 = ~(Tsujatha smiles in satisfaction nevertheless.~
@1311 = ~We are more alike than I had expected, Tsujatha.~
@1312 = ~In what way?~
@1313 = ~We both follow <CHARNAME> for the power that is in <PRO_HISHER> wake.~
@1314 = ~You presume to know me well.~
@1315 = ~We recognize our own.~
@1316 = ~I have seen the end of power, mage, and it is bitter. Beware of making it your sole desire.~
@1317 = ~It is a chance I will take. I know that the end of weakness is also bitter.~
@1318 = ~So, Tsujatha, I can see that you are not from this world. Are you from Athas by any chance?~
@1319 = ~Athas? I do not know such a world. Why would you think so?~
@1320 = ~Because, my hound, the Elves on Athas are gigantic like you.~
@1321 = ~I am from Gilalion, and there I am tall for an Elf. Most are about the same height as our humans.~
@1322 = ~Two meters is tall for anyone.~
@1323 = ~Are you proportionate? Are you big all over?~
@1324 = ~You fancy snails as well as oysters, do you, half-breed?~
@1325 = ~(Haer'Dalis' eyes flash angrily.)~
@1326 = ~Half-breed?!~
@1327 = ~(Tsujatha smiles ironically.)~
@1328 = ~I did not know Athas, but Sigil and its spawn I know.~
@1329 = ~Then you know well that only the foolhardy call a tiefling a half-breed! ~
@1330 = ~The foolhardy...or the strong.~
@1331 = ~Strong, my hound, and yet still foolhardy.~
@1332 = ~So, tiefling, do you often sojourn on the Prime?~
@1333 = ~You have learned the chant, berk, but do you really know the dark of Planar travel?~
@1334 = ~I know enough to realize that your Raelis Shai was quite the fool to cross a Factol.~
@1335 = ~You *do* know the Cage. How long were you there?~
@1336 = ~Long enough to develop a distaste for the Doomguard.~
@1337 = ~Oh? And what faction would take YOU in, Clueless?~
@1338 = ~I? I belong to no faction. Primes rarely join, as you know. My sympathies lie with the Fated, however.~
@1339 = ~I should have known you were a Taker.~
@1340 = ~I have dreamed of being truly Heartless. (Tsujatha glances over to you, noticing the puzzlement on your face at all the jargon.)~
@1341 = ~Enough. It is discourteous to continue to speak of such things without explaining them. We can speak more privately.~
@1342 = ~My hound, I have come to realize that there is much in you that I had not seen before.~
@1343 = ~Many have found that. Most have found it too late.~
@1344 = ~Is that a threat?~
@1345 = ~Not unless you choose to cross me.~
@1346 = ~I would not do so. You are dark, and there is a coldness in you that one of the Doomguard should cherish.~
@1347 = ~It is true. In Sigil even the Fated feared me; the Sensates shunned me; and the Dustmen thought I had already attained the true death.~
@1348 = ~Have you?~
@1349 = ~Perhaps I have.~
@1350 = ~There is no chaos in you, I admit. You are not entropic.~
@1351 = ~You are simply dark, yet the darkness is so deep that still you cause decay wherever you go.~
@1352 = ~It is hard not to fear emptiness when you have nothing in yourself, but if nothing is what you desire...~
@1353 = ~Ah my dark hound, nothing is not what we desire. It is destruction, and you provide that in plenty.~
@1354 = ~It is the truth.~
@1355 = ~Revel in your darkness, Prime.~
@1356 = ~I cannot.~
@1357 = ~Then I shall do it for you.~
@1358 = ~As you wish.~
@1359 = ~What is it, Imoen? You have been wanting to speak for the past quarter of an hour.~
@1360 = ~So, who are you?~
@1361 = ~I? I am Tsujatha, of the House of Melalor. (His glance is cold and appraising, and Imoen flinches beneath his gaze.)~
@1362 = ~You are a spell-caster, I think <CHARNAME> said. I hope that your rescue will be worth the price that we have paid.~
@1363 = ~I am <CHARNAME>'s sister! There is no placing a price on the bonds of friendship!~
@1364 = ~Really? I should have placed the value of a friend at a life. A soul is too high.~
@1365 = ~(Tsujatha sighs.) Again you wish to speak. You are not usually so hesitant. What is it, Imoen?~
@1366 = ~You said that the value of a friend is the value of your life.  Do you have any friends?~
@1367 = ~One. Perhaps.~
@1368 = ~Imoen, you are a puzzle to me.~
@1369 = ~The mighty wizard of the Otherworld has found a puzzle? Impossible!~
@1370 = ~That is precisely my puzzle. You are quite a child in your humor...~
@1371 = ~You mean my jokes are childish?~
@1372 = ~Or do you mean that I still remember how to laugh, something the rest of you seem to have forgotten?~
@1373 = ~Both. But I never knew how to laugh, not even when I was a child.~
@1374 = ~Maybe I could teach you now.~
@1375 = ~I do not think so. There are some wounds that laughter causes to bleed again.~
@1376 = ~I think I understand.~
@1377 = ~Perhaps you do. You have learned suffering, at any rate.~
@1378 = ~I wish I could forget.~
@1379 = ~There we differ. Would you be so weak as to forget all that the pain has brought you?~
@1380 = ~You mean <CHARNAME>, don't you?~
@1381 = ~You know best what your pain has purchased.~
@1382 = ~I am puzzled, Jaheira. You seem to share both the characteristics of the humans of this world and its Elves.~
@1383 = ~Do humans and Elves often mate in this world?  Or are you another race altogether?~
@1384 = ~I am a half-elf, yes.~
@1385 = ~Do you not feel that that is unnatural? The mating of two disparate races?~
@1386 = ~I am a druid! I serve nature!~
@1387 = ~(Wry amusement is in his voice, but his face remains expressionless.)~
@1388 = ~You devote equal time to the blade, Mistress Jaheira. In that, too, you are divided.~
@1389 = ~You do not mock <CHARNAME> with the unnaturalness of <PRO_HISHER> heritage!~
@1390 = ~I care not for nature. YOU are the one who claims to do that.~
@1391 = ~Begone, beast, before my blade divides *you*!~
@1392 = ~As you wish, Mistress Jaheira.~
@1393 = ~(Tsujatha smiles, however, and there is no anger in his face as he takes his place at the opposite end of the group from Jaheira.)~
@1394 = ~Mistress Jaheira, tell me more of this group of yours, the Harpers.~
@1395 = ~The Harpers are servants of goodness who go throughout the Realms seeking evil to destroy.~
@1396 = ~Evil? Such as cheating merchants?~
@1397 = ~Such as slave-traders. Or necromancers.~
@1398 = ~Ah. (He smiles, but the smile is hard. He says nothing more.)~
@1399 = ~(Her frustration that Tsujatha did not rise to take her bait is evident.)~
@1400 = ~Have you no defense to make, necromancer?~
@1401 = ~I need not defend myself against the accusations of one whose favor I do not desire.~
@1402 = ~It is not only my accusation! You have betrayed all that is Elven!~
@1403 = ~You have turned aside from walking in harmony with nature, from dwelling beneath the undisturbed trees, to this!~
@1404 = ~To the manipulation of death! To the creation of undead creatures, to...~
@1405 = ~Enough. I will answer you, if only to stop your mouth.~
@1406 = ~I am a necromancer. I do manipulate death. And this serves me well. It serves <CHARNAME> also.~
@1407 = ~My magicks have aided you, too, on occasion, Mistress Jaheira. I force death to do my bidding, to suck the lives I choose.~
@1408 = ~It is no different from the edge of your sword. You, too, deal out death to whomever you please.~
@1409 = ~Why is that any different?~
@1410 = ~(The half-elf tilts her head to the side, struck by this.) You reason well, Tsujatha.~
@1411 = ~My heart tells me there is a flaw somewhere in your words, but my mind cannot see it. We will be at peace. For now.~
@1412 = ~I had no quarrel with you in the first place, Mistress Jaheira.~
@1413 = ~Why did you become a Harper, Mistress Jaheira?~
@1414 = ~Because the Harpers do good. They actively seek out evil and destroy it; they are protectors of the good in Faerun.~
@1415 = ~But I thought you served the balance? The balance not only of law and chaos, but the balance of good and evil?~
@1416 = ~Is this not so?~
@1417 = ~Being a Harper does not prevent me from preserving the balance.~
@1418 = ~But you actively seek to do good.~
@1419 = ~I seek balance.~
@1420 = ~You seek goodness. (He smiles.) You are not, perhaps, the most orthodox of druids, but that is...all to the good.~
@1421 = ~(Jaheira shakes her head, unable to take offense at what is obviously meant as a compliment.)~
@1422 = ~What are you, Jan?~
@1423 = ~Let me guess. In that place where they grow out-size Elves like you, you don't have any gnomes?~
@1424 = ~I infer that you are a gnome.~
@1425 = ~I am indeed, and as great an expert on turnips as any gnome in Faerun.~
@1426 = ~Well, except perhaps for my Aunt Fenella. She could make a turnip stew that would put warts on your chest!~
@1427 = ~Warts?~
@1428 = ~Yes indeed! She was a cook to admire, I tell you. She...~
@1429 = ~No more, Jan. I have learned enough of gnomes for now.~
@1430 = ~But you haven't even gotten started! There's more to gnomes than turnips, you know. There's also griffon-baiting!~
@1431 = ~No more. (He walks away from Jan, leaving the gnome talking to himself.)~
@1432 = ~Did I ever tell you, Tsujatha, about my second cousin on my mother's side?~
@1433 = ~She...the cousin, that is, not my mother!...was traveling down to Calimshan...~
@1434 = ~Jan, you are tedious.~
@1435 = ~If it pleases your worship to say so.~
@1436 = ~But for my own poor part, if I were as tedious as...a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it ALL on your worship!~
@1437 = ~All thy tediousness on me?~
@1438 = ~(Jan ducks his head.)  Anyway, about my cousin...~
@1439 = ~No.(Tsujatha glances up at you and walks away from Jan.)~
@1440 = ~(The incorrigible gnome is undeterred, and the entire group is regaled with the tale of Jan's second cousin, the baker's daughter, and the bugbear.)~
@1441 = ~Jan, what is that dreadful odor?~
@1442 = ~Why, Tsujatha! Don't tell me they don't have turnips on your homeworld!~
@1443 = ~Why, such a thing as not having turnips is unknown even in the Abyss. Bhaal himself feasted on turnips every day!~
@1444 = ~The odor, I infer, is turnips.~
@1445 = ~And isn't it the most delectable fragrance you ever inhaled?~
@1446 = ~I should treat you all to my mother's aunt's recipe for turnip stew. It would cause even an Elf like you, Tsujatha, to...~
@1447 = ~Nothing involving turnips will ever cause me to do anything, Jan, except possibly to vomit if it reminds me too much of you.~
@1448 = ~(Jan has been going on for quite some time to no one in particular, but at last Tsujatha interrupts.)~
@1449 = ~Jan, you speak often of gryphon-baiting.~
@1450 = ~I do indeed. It is great sport! There is nothing better than...~
@1451 = ~Have you ever had the gryphon turn on you?~
@1452 = ~Not me! I'm too good a baiter for that. I know just how far I can push a gryphon.~
@1453 = ~My name means Gryphon. I hope that you use your gryphon-baiting knowledge to know when to stop baiting me.~
@1454 = ~. . . .~
@1455 = ~At last. Silence!~
@1456 = ~On the contrary, my dear friend. I have now realized why I so enjoy our little chats!~
@1457 = ~(Tsujatha shakes his head, disbelief written large on his face.)~
@1458 = ~(The gnome laughs in high glee, and his eyes dance.)~
@1459 = ~I will have to tell Uncle Spanky about this! He'll certainly be able to appreciate it.~
@1460 = ~I mean, an Elf-griffin is not so different from a gnome-griffin, and that was Uncle Spanky's specialty...~
@1461 = ~Kresek have mercy! The gnome is mad!~
@1462 = ~Not mad. Just merry, my Elf-griffin. But about my Uncle Spanky and the gnome-griffin...~
@1463 = ~(Tsujatha's eyes glaze over, and you find yourself smothering a smile as Jan's story goes on.)~
@1464 = ~(And on.)~
@1465 = ~So, Lord Keldorn, I hear that you are a paladin? Is that the correct word?~
@1466 = ~It is. I am a Knight of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart, a paladin in the service of Torm.~
@1467 = ~This means that you have devoted your life to the service of your god, does it not?~
@1468 = ~It does. And it is a lonely road.~
@1469 = ~I have a lovely wife and two sweet daughters, but my duty keeps me from them oftener than I would like.~
@1470 = ~But your Lady knew you were a paladin when you took her to wife, yes? Then she must understand.~
@1471 = ~Oh, my Maria does understand, but still I miss her presence.~
@1472 = ~You have my sympathy.~
@1473 = ~(Your eyes are drawn involuntarily to Tsujatha's face, for there is none of the sarcasm in his voice that you had expected.)~
@1474 = ~(Tsujatha appears totally in earnest, and the expression in his silver eyes is grave.)~
@1475 = ~What is your god, Tsujatha?~
@1476 = ~I follow none.~
@1477 = ~What is the god of your people, then? I know nothing of the gods of your world. Is Torm worshiped there?~
@1478 = ~No, there is no knowledge of Torm. Gilalion was created by three Powers under Silshivar, the Stargod.~
@1479 = ~They were Chiel, Lady of Light, Jehiel, Giver of Fruits, and Anthiel, the Windlord.~
@1480 = ~Of these, Anthiel fell from his place, and through him and his offspring Gilalion became corrupted.~
@1481 = ~Have you no god of the dead? No one who judges?~
@1482 = ~Yes, Kresek, son of the Lady of Light, is the Lord of the Dead. By him all Elves and Men are judged.~
@1483 = ~Is he merciful?~
@1484 = ~He is just.~
@1485 = ~Do you fear him?~
@1486 = ~No. There is no suffering that he can inflict greater than that which I have known.~
@1487 = ~You are sharp-tongued, Tsujatha.~
@1488 = ~That is true, Lord Keldorn.~
@1489 = ~Why have you not turned any of your venom on me? I am, I would suppose, the last man you would be kind to.~
@1490 = ~I respect you, Lord Keldorn.~
@1491 = ~But why, Tsujatha Melalor? What is there in this old knight that has earned your respect?~
@1492 = ~I know you too well to suppose that you give your respect away.~
@1493 = ~Your devotion and your honor.~
@1494 = ~I am what I am by the grace of Torm. He has allowed me to serve in this way.~
@1495 = ~And your humility. I admire such things, even if I have none of them myself.~
@1496 = ~You could be a good man, Tsujatha. Try.~
@1497 = ~I cannot, Lord Keldorn.  But I thank you for your kindness nonetheless.~
@1498 = ~What is in your mind, Lord Keldorn? You have been watching me this past half-hour.~
@1499 = ~You love the light, Tsujatha. Why have you gone into the darkness?~
@1500 = ~Because there is in me only darkness. I tried to be good.~
@1501 = ~I failed, and I realized that there was in me no desire to be good.~
@1502 = ~But you admire goodness. You seek it out. You honor it. You do truly love it.~
@1503 = ~Give up the darkness. You could be filled with the light you love.~
@1504 = ~No, I could not. The deeds that I have done can never be wiped out. The gods have given me over, Lord Keldorn.~
@1505 = ~I do not believe it.~
@1506 = ~I know it.~
@1507 = ~What are you, Korgan?~
@1508 = ~Now what sort of question is that, ye overgrown elf?~
@1509 = ~An honest one. (There is a hint of a smile on Tsujatha's face, but his eyes remain as cold as ever.)~
@1510 = ~If yer truly so ignorant as not to know a dwarf when you see one, then there's no help for ye!~
@1511 = ~A dwarf? So you are a stunted human?~
@1512 = ~Now who are ye calling stunted? And I ain't a bloody human!~
@1513 = ~(Tsujatha turns away from Korgan, murmuring under his breath.)~
@1514 = ~Another new race of this world.  And an unpleasant one at that.~
@1515 = ~Now what's that, wizard? (The dwarf takes a step after Tsujatha.) Yer not planning to run off on me now, are ye?~
@1516 = ~I have never fled a battle in my life, dwarf. But I do not think that <CHARNAME> wants this to become a battle.~
@1517 = ~(Tsujatha glances at you and lowers his voice.) However, if you do want a battle, I am for you. Remember it.~
@1518 = ~I will. Of that ye can be sure!~
@1519 = ~Do your people ever give much thought to magic?~
@1520 = ~Why would we do a thing like that? Magic is an unreliable, pesky sort of thing.~
@1521 = ~An axe, a hammer, a good blade-these are the things a dwarf can depend on!~
@1522 = ~(The dwarf sighs contentedly.) Aye, me axe has gutted more enemies than I can count!~
@1523 = ~So you do not enchant your weapons?~
@1524 = ~Of course we do, Elf. All's fair in war!~
@1525 = ~Of course. (Tsujatha's repetition of the words is mocking.)~
@1526 = ~Is inconsistency something you strive for, or does it come naturally to you?~
@1527 = ~You...you...~
@1528 = ~Are you ready to challenge me?~
@1529 = ~Yer jest tryin' to pick a fight!~
@1530 = ~You noticed.~
@1531 = ~Whenever <CHARNAME> sets us up, I'll fight ye, squeakie!~
@1532 = ~I will be ready.~
@1533 = ~How about now?~
@1534 = ~It does not appear that <CHARNAME> is ready for such a battle...yet.~
@1535 = ~So, squeakie...~
@1536 = ~Repeat that name at your peril.~
@1537 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have taken you as my commander. You are responsible for my actions insofar as you are my commander.~
@1538 = ~If you would not have the death of this dwarf on your hands, send him away, for, by Kresek, I shall slay him if he remains in my presence.~
@1539 = ~There is no need for violence, Tsujatha. We can all just get along peaceably.~
@1540 = ~If it comes to a choice between you and Korgan, I choose you.~
@1541 = ~If it comes to a choice between you and Korgan, I choose Korgan.~
@1542 = ~You chose wisely, <CHARNAME>.~
@1543 = ~If ye prefer this damned squeakie to a battle-ready dwarf, ye deserve each other!~
@1544 = ~I wouldn't stay with ye for a mountain of good gold!~
@1545 = ~I knew ye were bright, <CHARNAME>.~
@1546 = ~This is unexpectedly foolish, <CHARNAME>, but I will leave you to your folly.~
@1547 = ~I cannot endure him. Either you will send him away, or I shall kill him.~
@1548 = ~Go ahead. Try to kill him.~
@1549 = ~With pleasure, <CHARNAME>.~
@1550 = ~What is this? A child? Why has <CHARNAME> taken a little girl into the group?~
@1551 = ~Little girl?! I am no child, you over-grown elf-giant! I am a knight in the service of Arvoreen!~
@1552 = ~A knight? (He laughs, but there is a hollowness in the sound.) Perhaps you may be a knight when you grow up?~
@1553 = ~I AM grown up! Have you never seen a halfling before?~
@1554 = ~No. I take it that halflings are those of your race?~
@1555 = ~(Mazzy seems somewhat appeased, and the fight fades out of her eyes.)~
@1556 = ~I do not know where <CHARNAME> found you that you do not know about halflings, but I will give you the grace accorded to ignorance.~
@1557 = ~I am above taking offense at unintentional insults.~
@1558 = ~(Tsujatha smiles sardonically.) It was not meant as an insult. When I mean for you to take offense, there will be no doubt of my intentions.~
@1559 = ~Are all your people like you, Lady Fentan?~
@1560 = ~What do you mean? (There is a suspicious edge to her voice that does not surprise you.)~
@1561 = ~Knights, paladins, adventurers?~
@1562 = ~(The halfling smiles slightly.) No, Master Tsujatha, they are not.~
@1563 = ~Most halflings despise the wandering life. We are a settled people, given to much eating and drinking and laughing.~
@1564 = ~You do not laugh much, Lady Fentan.~
@1565 = ~No, I do not. I do not have time to laugh. I am a knight, serving Arvoreen, and my days are spent in battle and toil.~
@1566 = ~You battle that others might have peace. You are truly a noble lady.~
@1567 = ~Are you a paladin, Lady Fentan?~
@1568 = ~No, Tsujatha.  I am not, and I never can be.~
@1569 = ~Why not? You are a true knight, full of honor and piety. Does Arvoreen not have paladins?~
@1570 = ~Halflings cannot become paladins. (There is sorrow in her voice, and you glance toward Tsujatha, instinctively expecting the lash of his tongue.)~
@1571 = ~I do not understand this, Lady Fentan. The workings of religion on this world are still unknown to me.~
@1572 = ~But this much I do know. Your heart is as steadfast and your honor is as bright as that of any paladin in all Faerun. Be comforted.~
@1573 = ~Your words are kind, Tsujatha. Thank you.~
@1574 = ~(The conversation ends, and you are left puzzled by Tsujatha's unexpected gentleness.)~
@1575 = ~Master Tsujatha, I am puzzled by you.~
@1576 = ~You seem to prize both virtue and honor, but you do not hold yourself to the standards of either.~
@1577 = ~No.~
@1578 = ~But why? When you so obviously appreciate goodness, why do you not devote yourself to it?~
@1579 = ~There is no goodness in me, Lady Fentan. The seeds of honor must have some soil in which to take root, and my soul is entirely black.~
@1580 = ~I have embraced damnation with open arms...and open eyes.~
@1581 = ~Then I am truly sorry for you, Master Tsujatha.~
@1582 = ~I thank you for your pity, Lady Fentan, but it is wasted on me.~
@1583 = ~I made my choice long ago, and there is no room now for repentance or returning.~
@1584 = ~You are a ranger?~
@1585 = ~Yes, of course! Boo and I...~
@1586 = ~Your rodent. (He turns away with an almost imperceptible shake of his head. Minsc is left talking only to Boo.)~
@1587 = ~I have seen you lose control in battle, Minsc, and you grow stronger.~
@1588 = ~Yes. Minsc is a berserker! My rage is a mighty force that evil finds on its backside!~
@1589 = ~Were you always so insane?~
@1590 = ~What do you mean? Minsc is not crazy! Minsc and Boo form a mighty pair that seeks out evil!~
@1591 = ~We destroy it! My sword slices into evil, and my boot seeks its butt!~
@1592 = ~So you have always been mad.~
@1593 = ~Minsc is not angry. And Boo is only a little annoyed. Where are you going?~
@1594 = ~(Tsujatha walks away from Minsc, leaving the ranger alone with his hamster.)~
@1595 = ~Tsujatha, Boo wants to know...~
@1596 = ~I care nothing for what your rodent may wish to know.~
@1597 = ~Boo is no ordinary hamster! He is a miniature giant space hamster, and he is the one who helps Minsc with the difficult questions of life.~
@1598 = ~Boo wants to know how you got here.~
@1599 = ~I walked.~
@1600 = ~Boo meant...I think...you mean you walked all the way from your world?~
@1601 = ~If you can believe it.~
@1602 = ~Minsc can believe it!~
@1603 = ~I knew you could.~
@1604 = ~You are of the nobility of this land then, Mistress Nalia?~
@1605 = ~Of course. I am the only child of Lord De'Arnise.~
@1606 = ~That explains the haughtiness of your manner then.~
@1607 = ~I am NOT haughty! Why, I've helped countless beggars. I've crept out of the keep at night to help your kind!~
@1608 = ~You make unwarranted assumptions, Mistress Nalia.~
@1609 = ~I do not!~
@1610 = ~I was born the only son of an ancient and proud house, one of the noble houses amongst the Fair Elves.~
@1611 = ~Before my second century I was Prince of the Golden Desert.~
@1612 = ~You're a Prince?~
@1613 = ~On my homeworld.~
@1614 = ~I don't believe you! You're just saying that to impress me.~
@1615 = ~Again, an unwarranted assumption.~
@1616 = ~What?~
@1617 = ~That I wish to impress you.~
@1618 = ~You seem to specialize in death magic, Tsujatha, but that cannot be.~
@1619 = ~Why is it impossible for me to be a necromancer?~
@1620 = ~Because you're an Elf!~
@1621 = ~And?~
@1622 = ~And Elves don't...they can't...become necromancers!~
@1623 = ~Why not?~
@1624 = ~It's unnatural, and Elves are bound to nature, of course. (She speaks as though to a young child.)~
@1625 = ~Even if the Elves of Faerun were barred from doing so, I am not of Faerun.~
@1626 = ~And I would not recommend mocking those whose power exceeds your own.~
@1627 = ~I wasn't. I mean, I wasn't mocking you. It is beneath a noble to mock those beneath her.~
@1628 = ~(A smirk crosses his face at Nalia's childish phrasing, but his eyes are serious as he responds.)~
@1629 = ~It would be best for your health if you gave up these assumptions. I am of higher birth than you are, but it hurts your pride to think so.~
@1630 = ~You consider yourself a new type of noble, but those who have made a career of patronizing kindness have been amongst the nobility since its inception.~
@1631 = ~(Nalia blushes and turns away, unable to reply.)~
@1632 = ~Tsujatha, were you truly of noble birth?~
@1633 = ~I was. I have already told you so. I was a Prince.~
@1634 = ~And what is the attitude of the nobility of your...Golden Desert you said?~
@1635 = ~The nobles of the Golden Desert live for their people. Their royal House pours out its blood like water for the sake of the nation.~
@1636 = ~So they would like me there?~
@1637 = ~Why?~
@1638 = ~Because I help the populace, too!~
@1639 = ~Ah. No.~
@1640 = ~But I do!~
@1641 = ~No. (He walks away from Nalia, leaving the young woman both frustrated and annoyed.)~
@1642 = ~Tell me of this curse you bear, Valygar.~
@1643 = ~You mock me, mage.~
@1644 = ~Not yet.~
@1645 = ~You do not know what it is to have to slay your mother for cursing your father.~
@1646 = ~Indeed, I do not. My father slew my mother for me. He was the one whom I killed.~
@1647 = ~(The ranger continues bitterly, ignoring the interruption.)~
@1648 = ~You do not know what it is for your name to be the by-word of an entire city. You do not know what it is to be known and distrusted for your blood.~
@1649 = ~On the contrary, my name is considered so black that it is not spoken in any of the four Elven nations.~
@1650 = ~My father's name is a curse, not a by-word. I have been hunted to my death for the sake of my name. I am, like you, the last of my line.~
@1651 = ~Unlike you, I do not fear my blood. I, not my father, am the arbiter of my fate.~
@1652 = ~You are too weak to choose your own destiny, so you walk in fear and in the shadow of your ancestors.~
@1653 = ~You warn us oft of the dangers of dark, foul magic.~
@1654 = ~Why, Valygar, do you not warn us of thieves or dangerous swords or knives in the back? (The wizard's tone is thick with mockery.)~
@1655 = ~Because magic is more dangerous!~
@1656 = ~I do not disagree that magic is more powerful than any blade. Yet you object to the use of magic even on our own side.~
@1657 = ~You dislike mages.~
@1658 = ~I hate them.~
@1659 = ~Yet you pity them, too.~
@1660 = ~Yes, I suppose I do. I know I pitied Lavok.~
@1661 = ~In that you are weak. Lavok was repentant, yes, but he earned his fate. He deserved what he received.~
@1662 = ~Death was release to him. It shall not be so for you, despite all your shunning of magic.~
@1663 = ~You blunt your own weapons by not using this most powerful of tools.~
@1664 = ~Then I blunt them.~
@1665 = ~And in this, too, you are weak.~
@1666 = ~(Valygar shrugs.) So be it.~
@1667 = ~Is there anything you fear, Tsujatha?~
@1668 = ~I wish to know more of your character.~
@1669 = ~You fear magic; I represent magic. You wish to know if there is anything I, as a wizard, fear. No.~
@1670 = ~You are fearless? I cannot believe it.~
@1671 = ~I do not care whether you do or not.~
@1672 = ~Is there anything you, as a man, fear? Wizard and ranger aside, we are both men. What do you fear?~
@1673 = ~What is there to fear but loss? There is but one thing precious that I have; therefore there is but one thing I can lose.~
@1674 = ~Only that do I fear.~
@1675 = ~This was not the answer I had expected.~
@1676 = ~Of course not.~
@1677 = ~Why do they seek to kill you, Viconia?~
@1678 = ~I am drow, ibilith. What more reason do they need?~
@1679 = ~Drow? You seem like enough to the other Elves I have met in this world.~
@1680 = ~What is the source of the enmity between you and the others?~
@1681 = ~You have no racial enmities on your plane?~
@1682 = ~My plane is the Prime Material, Viconia. My world does have such things, but not amongst Elves.~
@1683 = ~They do not consider us Elves any longer. (Her eyes travel over Tsujatha's well-muscled form, and a lascivious gleam appears in them.)~
@1684 = ~They would not...do not...consider you an Elf, either. You are too big. (The implication is not lost on Tsujatha, but there is no trace of embarrassment on his face.)~
@1685 = ~What others consider me is of little matter. What YOU consider me is of no matter whatever.~
@1686 = ~Tsujatha, you are more sensible than most Elves I have met on the surface of Faerun.~
@1687 = ~You at least do not discount drow when you see them.~
@1688 = ~You compliment me.~
@1689 = ~I do indeed. And I know how to appreciate such things in a man. Do you know what we drow are known for on the surface?~
@1690 = ~Murder? (His voice is even and betrays no emotion.)~
@1691 = ~Besides that. (Viconia laughs and traces Tsujatha's jaw with a slender forefinger.)~
@1692 = ~We are known for our skills in the erotic arts. I could show you delights beyond your imagination.~
@1693 = ~(She leans in toward his face, and her breath is on his cheek.)~
@1694 = ~Viconia, I have no interest in a common stale.~
@1695 = ~(He draws back, and the drow is left standing alone.)~
@1696 = ~Tell me of this heirloom that you seek. Why is it important to you?~
@1697 = ~It is all that remains to me of my father.~
@1698 = ~It is the weakness of surfacers to hold so tightly to the bonds of family.~
@1699 = ~(Tsujatha makes a sound remarkably like a snort.)~
@1700 = ~Why do you laugh? You are weak to cling so to your father.~
@1701 = ~I do not cling to him. I killed him.~
@1702 = ~Truly? (There is astonished admiration in her eyes.)~
@1703 = ~Why should I lie? Lies are only told for the benefit of the liar. What benefit would I gain from this?~
@1704 = ~My admiration, abbil.~
@1705 = ~And this benefits me in what way?~
@1706 = ~You have not tasted the delights a drow can offer.~
@1707 = ~Nor do I wish to. I have slain my father, and I do not hide this.~
@1708 = ~But I do not make it a boast to draw a woman to my bed. I can have women without effort, and such as would desire me for my cruelty are not such as I would myself desire.~
@1709 = ~Why do your eyes follow me, Viconia?~
@1710 = ~You are not a fool, Tsujatha. You know why.~
@1711 = ~My opinion of your intelligence was higher than this. Why do you desire me? What is there in me that attracts you?~
@1712 = ~You are beautiful.~
@1713 = ~You are yourself lovely to look upon, Viconia. You could find many other mates.~
@1714 = ~Why do you continue to desire me when I have made it clear that I have no interest in you?~
@1715 = ~Because I am curious to learn what it would be like to have an Elf couple with me voluntarily.~
@1716 = ~No surface Elf of Faerun ever would.~
@1717 = ~This you shall not learn from me. I have no desire for you, Viconia. Your heart is dark.~
@1718 = ~(Viconia laughs harshly.) This reproach from you? You whose blackness is the talk of your homeworld?~
@1719 = ~Like a moth, I am attracted to the light...and only to the light.~
@1720 = ~Though for myself I have embraced the dark, I do not find it beautiful.~
@1721 = ~I am proud, abbil. You shall not be given the opportunity to service me again.~
@1722 = ~Of that I am glad.~
@1723 = ~Who are you, Yoshimo?~
@1724 = ~That is a strange question. To ask a man's name in the same breath with which you use it?~
@1725 = ~It was not your name I wished to know. There is magic on you, strong magic.~
@1726 = ~I can smell it. Yet you do not use magic of any kind, and this is puzzling.~
@1727 = ~I trust to my own skill and expertise.~
@1728 = ~Are they enough to protect you?~
@1729 = ~They will have to be.~
@1730 = ~You speak as though you are not from this area of Faerun. Tell me, Yoshimo, where are you from?~
@1731 = ~I am from the land of Kara-Tur, a place where honor, duty, and loyalty are revered as they never are here.~
@1732 = ~If that is so, then perhaps this Kara-Tur would be more similar to my own homeland. Honor is paramount in the Dylak Thana.~
@1733 = ~I thought you said you were from Gilalion.~
@1734 = ~Gilalion is my world; my nation is the Dylak Thana.~
@1735 = ~Does that name have any meaning?~
@1736 = ~It means the Golden Desert. The land where I dwelt was harsh and unforgiving, as are the principles of its people.~
@1737 = ~Who was your lord there?~
@1738 = ~I was the Prince. (Tsujatha speaks matter-of-factly.)~
@1739 = ~I see.~
@1740 = ~You are *skilled in the arts of avoidance,* Yoshimo?~
@1741 = ~I have said it.~
@1742 = ~Where did you learn such a trade? Is it common amongst your people?~
@1743 = ~Not common, but there are those who are trained to be assassins. My lord might have need of such a one.~
@1744 = ~Was your profession chosen for you, then?~
@1745 = ~No, it was not precisely chosen for me. It was simply the one for which I showed most aptitude.~
@1746 = ~I see. (There is a note in Tsujatha's voice that had not been there before, and you notice that he watches Yoshimo intently thereafter.)~
@1747 = ~I find your presence most annoying, Tsujatha.~
@1748 = ~You had not seemed to find me so displeasing before now.~
@1749 = ~Perhaps not, but that was before I learned what a pathetic excuse for a male that you are.~
@1750 = ~Pathetic? It is a perilous word to use of me.~
@1751 = ~Only the most pitiful of males would have become so weak and squeamish when his mistress had dismissed him.~
@1752 = ~You tread dangerously, Viconia!~
@1753 = ~(The drow laughs.) You are angry, and therefore you have lost the control you so highly prize.~
@1754 = ~And I have already achieved my purpose.~
@1755 = ~Do not speak to me again, drow!~
@1756 = ~You will not have the satisfaction of hearing my voice, jaluk.~


@5000 = ~Recover the Riose Sar for Tsujatha.

Tsujatha Melalor has joined my party. He is in search of a family heirloom, which I have agreed to help him find. Our first lead is to speak to Flan Brel in the Bridge district.~

@5001 = ~Recover the Riose Sar for Tsujatha.

After some quite effective *persuasion* on Tsujatha's part, Flan Brel has betrayed his master to us. Sorkyst can be found in the North Forest. After giving us this information, Flan Brel met with his untimely demise at the hands of Tsujatha.~

@5002 = ~Recover the Riose Sar for Tsujatha.

We have agreed to go to the Prison to rescue a man named Javin for Flan Brel. In return, Flan Brel has promised to give us the location of Sorkyst, the thief of Tsujatha's treasure.~

@5003 = ~Recover the Riose Sar for Tsujatha.
