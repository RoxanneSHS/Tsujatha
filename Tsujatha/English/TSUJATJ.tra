@164  = ~ (Tsujatha runs his forefinger down your cheek, causing a shiver to travel your spine.) You are correct, <CHARNAME>. It *is* pleasant. (He smiles at your discomfiture, but as he turns away you catch a softened expression on his face that does not fade for many minutes.)~
@165  = ~ Is there something on my face, <CHARNAME>?~
@166  = ~Yes, just a speck of dust, but it's gone now. (You brush his cheek.) ~

@192  = ~(A small sound of surprise escapes you, and Tsujatha looks down into your face.)~
@193  = ~It is a custom of my people. (His explanation does not perplex you, but the realization that your thoughts are so open to him does.)  ~
@194  = ~(You slip up next to Tsujatha and slide your arms around him.)~

@225  = ~(He seems locked in place, and there is pain in his eyes.)~
@226  = ~(You return guiltily to your place, wondering why his heart is so raw.) ~
@227  = ~Indeed? (Tsujatha's eyebrows rise.) I think you mean more than you say, <CHARNAME>.~
@228  = ~ I? Not at all, I assure you.  I am merely commenting on your above-average . . . height.~
@229  = ~ Of course I do.  A big strapping Elf like you must have all sorts of hidden talents.~
@230  = ~ My height?  Ah, <CHARNAME>, you will have to do better than that.  ~
@231  = ~ (Tsujatha's eyes widen at your forwardness, but he smiles as he leans down to whisper in your ear.) I do indeed. ~
@232  = ~ Why, yes. (Tsujatha looks at you with feigned innocence.) I *am* rather larger than usual.~
@233  = ~(You blush at his response, and Tsujatha laughs. It is an unusual sound from him, but you find you enjoy it.) ~
@234  = ~ And you seem rather smaller than I am accustomed to.~

@236  = ~(Tsujatha chuckles at your blush, and his face retains its pleased expression.) ~
@237  = ~(Tsujatha shakes his head slightly.) Why, <CHARNAME>, I did not know you had it in you.~
@238  = ~Oh wait. You have not yet.~
@239  = ~(Tsujatha's golden coloring does not alter in the slightest, but you feel the red rising up in your cheeks.) ~

And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
And I'll not look for wine.~

Doth ask a drink divine:
But might I of Jove's nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.~

@244  = ~ (Tsujatha has been silent for so long that you are beginning to wonder if he will ever speak again. You realize that this quality of stillness, this undisturbed patience, is part of the complete control he has over himself.  You wish to disturb this impassivity, and you appeal to him in poetry.) ~

And now, like amorous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour
Than languish in his slow-chapped power. ~

Our sweetness up into one ball,
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Thorough the iron gates of life:~

Stand still, yet we will make him run. ~

@249  = ~ (You find that your eyes have been resting on Tsujatha's face for the past quarter of an hour, and you realize that an old poem from your days in Candlekeep has come back to you. It has been replaying in your mind in its entirety, and you want to share it with Tsujatha. You begin reciting in a low voice, but you know he hears.) ~
@250  = ~ He walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in his aspect and his eyes:
Thus mellow'd to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies. ~
@251  = ~ One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er his face:
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place. ~
@252  = ~ And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent! ~
@253  = ~(Tsujatha turns to look into your eyes, and his voice is low and shaken as he responds.) I thank you for your sweetness, gentle <CHARNAME>, but there is no goodness or innocence in me. Any that you see is only your own reflection.  ~

@255  = ~There is much to tell, so much that the task becomes nigh impossible. But at this moment there is one thing in my mind.~

@261  = ~There is nothing like it outside the Golden Desert of my home.~
@262  = ~ My life? (Tsujatha seems to become lost in thought.)~
@263  = ~My life was difficult. I was raised by foster parents for a time, and then they cast me out.~
@264  = ~I dwelt alone for many years, until Sillara took me in and made me her brother.~

@267  = ~(Tsujatha gives no explanation for his amendment of his last sentence, but you do not need one. The upward curve of his lips is enough.) ~
@268  = ~ Gilalion is the most beautiful world I have seen, and I have journeyed across several worlds in this plane and even to other planes.~
@269  = ~There is a vividness to the colors there, a nobility in the very shape of the mountains, that is lacking in any other world.~
@270  = ~But this world is the first I have ever seen which offers something to more than make up for that.~
@271  = ~(Tsujatha smiles meaningfully at you, and you need no more words.) ~
@272  = ~(You catch Tsujatha's eye and wink. He looks around, startled, searching for what your wink was meant to convey.)~
@273  = ~(Seeing no imminent danger, he relaxes, but the light-hearted mood you sought is absent.) ~
@274  = ~ (In an unexpected return, Tsujatha winks back at you.) ~
@275  = ~ (Tsujatha touches your face just below your eye.) I think I have gotten it out now.~
@276  = ~(He then slides his hand along your jaw, and you know that he feels the increased pace of your pulse beneath his touch.)~
@277  = ~(Tsujatha does not seem to have noticed your wink, but then you see shimmering in the air before the outline of his silver eye, winking back at you.)~
@278  = ~(The cantrip vanishes almost instantly, but you are pleased with his unwontedly playful response.) ~
@279  = ~(Your eyes trace the outline of Tsujatha's muscular form. You are surprised to notice that the body of any mage is so well-developed, but you do recall a passing reference he once made to his nation being one of warriors.)~
@280  = ~ (Tsujatha strides like a warrior rather than a wizard, carrying himself with the easy grace of one used to parrying sword-strikes. His robes are rich, despite their severe coloring. Apart from the deep green that lines his cloak, you have never seen any color break up the unrelieved black of his robes.)~
@281  = ~(The black contrasts well with his skin, and you follow the flowing lines of the robes up to his face.  There you see his eyes fixed on you quizzically, and you turn away, blushing.) ~
@282  = ~ (This time you focus on Tsujatha's hair. It is longer than most Faerun Elves wear theirs, and you admire its silky thickness. He wears it loose, and its glossiness seems only to emphasize its utter blackness.) ~
@283  = ~(From his hair it is an easy step to admiring Tsujatha's face. His cheekbones are high, and his silver eyes are wide-set. His nose is tall and almost, but not quite, aquiline, recalling the nobility of his blood.) ~
@284  = ~(Tsujatha's lips are firm and full, and you wonder what it would be like to feel those lips on your body. Not wanting Tsujatha to realize he has been the object of your reverie, you focus your eyes on the horizon before he looks at you.) ~
@285  = ~ (Tsujatha is absorbed in something to his left, and you seize the opportunity to admire his profile. The height of his nose is once more apparent, as is the unconscious pride in the way he moves. The very tilt of his head seems to bespeak his confidence in his own abilities.)~
@286  = ~(His robes do not hide his grace, and he moves with the easy agility of a hunting cat. His brow is slightly furrowed now, as if what he sees has displeased him. You realize that he will be looking your way in a moment, but you do not want to remove your eyes from him.) ~
@287  = ~ (He does turn toward you, and the furrow of his brow is replaced with puzzlement as he grasps that you have been staring at him.) ~
@288  = ~ (Tsujatha is not looking at you, and you relish the chance to observe him undetected. Tsujatha's chest is broad, and his height, the most striking thing about him in this world of much smaller Elves, is impressive.) ~
@289  = ~(His jaw is strong and stubborn, and you realize with chagrin that it probably looks much like your own in this respect. Tsujatha, like you has been an outcast for the sake of his blood, and it shows in his bearing.) ~
@290  = ~ (There is wariness in his eyes that you have never seen absent from them, and the unconscious squaring of his shoulders cuts you. He seems always tensed to receive or parry a blow. Sorrow flows over you, and you look away from Tsujatha, unable to watch him any longer for now.) ~
@291  = ~ (You notice Tsujatha's eyes on you, and you smile at him encouragingly.)~
@292  = ~(Perhaps disconcerted at having been caught observing you, Tsujatha glances away without answering your smile.) ~
@293  = ~ (Tsujatha slowly smiles in return. The expression seems to sit uneasily on his face, however, and it soon fades.) ~
@294  = ~ (Tsujatha tilts his head to the side.) What is it, <CHARNAME>? (Your friendliness seems to be more of a puzzle than a pleasure to him.) ~
@295  = ~(In response, Tsujatha smiles at you, and you are struck by the sorrow that clings to his eyes despite the curve of his lips. You resolve to one day strike the sadness from him, but in the meantime, he is at least smiling.) ~
@296  = ~(You blow a kiss to Tsujatha, but he does not seem to understand.)~
@297  = ~(He looks behind him for the recipient of your kiss, but he sees no one.)~
@298  = ~(A slight furrow appears between his brows, and he is preoccupied for the next several miles.) ~
@299  = ~ (Tsujatha sees you kiss your hand to him, and he bows his head in acknowledgement.)~
@300  = ~(His lips curve upward slightly, and an unaccustomed smiles rests on his face.) ~
@301  = ~ (Tsujatha shakes his head.) <CHARNAME>, that will not do. I have not yet deserved such a thing from you.~
@302  = ~(His words are solemn, but there is pleasure in his glance nonetheless.) ~
@303  = ~ (Tsujatha chuckles slightly, and he reaches up as though to catch the kiss. You are astonished to see red lip-marks appear in his hand.) ~
@304  = ~(Tsujatha is not looking at you, and you seize the moment to tickle him.)~
@305  = ~(Your fingers easily find his flesh through his robes, but to your surprise he does not seem aware of your tickling.)~
@306  = ~(You look up into his face, and the fervent gleam in his eyes causes you to look back down at once.)~
@307  = ~(You see the results of your touch in an unexpected area, and only then do you realize just how low on his hips you were touching him.)~
@308  = ~(You pull your hands out of his robes, blushing furiously.) ~
@309  = ~ (Tsujatha is occupied with rummaging for something in his pack, and you choose this undefended moment to attack him with tickles.)~
@310  = ~ (As you begin your charge, Tsujatha whirls around, his hands flashing fire.)~
@311  = ~(When he realizes that it is you, playing, he relaxes, and the flames surrounding his fingers die down.)~
@312  = ~ (The light-hearted moment has passed, however.) ~
@313  = ~ (Your tickling fingers catch Tsujatha on his ribs, and he squirms delightfully beneath your touch.)~
@314  = ~(A chuckle escapes him, and you return to your place, well-satisfied.)~
@315  = ~(Only then do you realize the dangers of teasing a wizard, for an irresistible tickle begins on your own ribs.)~
@316  = ~(It glides up and down on your torso, and at last you collapse, laughing.)~
@317  = ~(You glance at Tsujatha, and you are pleased to see that he is smiling.) I think we are even now, <CHARNAME>. ~
@318  = ~(You begin to tickle Tsujatha, mussing his robes. He retaliates, and your own garments are soon askew.)~
@319  = ~(After a few moments, you realize that your bare skin is touching Tsujatha's, and you feel your already increased heart-rate begin to speed up even more.)~
@320  = ~(Tsujatha seems to have become aware of the same thing at the same moment, for he smiles, a gleam of desire in his eyes.)~
@321  = ~Your games are...most amusing, <CHARNAME>, if somewhat dangerously intimate. ~
@322  = ~ (Tsujatha's eyes narrow.) Indeed? I am not accustomed to making errors of that kind.~
@323  = ~If you have changed your mind concerning me, I am at least grateful you have chosen to tell me, even if you have used a lie to do so. ~
@324  = ~(Your eyes play over Tsujatha, your love and your lover, and your heart thrills to his presence.)~
@325  = ~(Hold Tsujatha's hand.)  ~
@326  = ~Tsujatha, tell me about your past. ~
@327  = ~(Kiss Tsujatha lightly.) ~
@328  = ~(Kiss Tsujatha lightly.)  ~
@329  = ~(Leap into Tsujatha's arms.) ~
@330  = ~(Shake your booty at Tsujatha.) ~
@331  = ~(Kiss Tsujatha passionately.) ~
@332  = ~(Nestle your head against Tsujatha's chest.) ~
@333  = ~I love you, Tsujatha. ~
@334  = ~Tsujatha, could you help me with my hair? I've gotten something tangled in it. ~
@335  = ~You look tense, Tsujatha. Would you like a massage? ~
@336  = ~(Flash Tsujatha with your breasts.) ~
@337  = ~(Touch Tsujatha intimately.) ~
@338  = ~(Pant at Tsujatha.) ~
@339  = ~(Kiss Tsujatha's ear.) ~
@340  = ~Tsujatha, I am getting rather sore with all this marching. I think that I will need a full body massage tonight to help me rest. ~
@341  = ~Tsujatha, I want you to make passionate love to me RIGHT NOW! ~
@342  = ~(Bathe with Tsujatha.) ~
@343  = ~(Bathe with Tsujatha.)~
@344  = ~(Tsujatha takes your other hand and pulls you to face him.)~
@345  = ~(You stand before him, not touching at any point except your hands.)~
@346  = ~(You notice that his breath is coming unevenly, and he raises both your hands and places them over his heart.)~
@347  = ~(He says nothing, but neither does he release you until you move.)~
@348  = ~(Tsujatha raises your hand to lips and briefly kisses it. He does not let go of your hand when he lowers it, however, and you walk hand-in-hand for some time.)~
@349  = ~(Tsujatha intertwines his fingers with yours, and he looks down at you in delight.) I was desirous of your touch. Thank you, my heart.~
@350  = ~(The feel of Tsujatha's hand in your is inexpressibly comforting, and you walk on, feeling safer than you would have imagined possible, considering your circumstances.)~
@351  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes darken.) My past before I met you, Lady-love, is not a pleasant thing. I would rather forget it. For me, my life began the day I saw your face.~
@352  = ~What would you know, <CHARNAME>?~
@353  = ~I grew up in a tiny village not far from the borders of our desert land.~
@354  = ~I was raised without knowledge of my blood and heritage until well after I had come of age.~
@355  = ~Then I learned that I was the only son of long-dead necromancer, the greatest traitor in all the history of the Elves.~
@356  = ~(Tsujatha shrugs slightly.) I had no friends when I was a child.~
@357  = ~I was mocked by the other children, until I learned to harness the Mir magic in my blood.~
@358  = ~It was not a pleasant life.~
@359  = ~Would you hear of my past adventures? I have fought Nohr...a kind of giant...and Men.~
@360  = ~I have battled wizards and warriors. Together with Sillara, I battled a Dragon before the gates of Halchek, the city of the Tamari King.~
@361  = ~It was in Halchek that I dwelt after Sillara's departure to marry Lord Kan-Terak.~
@362  = ~(Tsujatha smiles suddenly at you.) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You have reminded me of the joy I have gained here in Faerun. It is the sweetest of all joys, that of release from sorrow.~
@363  = ~Even if you had given me no other gift, the gift of freedom from the weight of jealousy and thwarted revenge would be treasure enough to make me love you the rest of my days.~
@364  = ~My past is dark, my fair one. I have killed often.~
@365  = ~Sometimes it was blameless in me; I have fought for my life as often as you have for yours.~
@366  = ~Other times it was not. I have killed men for being in my way. I have killed men for crossing me.~
@367  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes narrow as he looks into your face.) Say that you forgive me, best beloved one. I need to hear that you can look past this to love me.~
@368  = ~I do forgive you, Tsujatha.~
@369  = ~I am not the one you have injured, Tsujatha. I cannot forgive injuries done to others. But I do love you.~
@370  = ~(Tsujatha relaxes, and he impulsively kisses your cheek.) You are too good, <CHARNAME>. You are far too good for me.~
@371  = ~(Something akin to awe lights in Tsujatha's face, and he reverently kisses your hand.) I think that you are holy, <CHARNAME>. You are certainly far too good for me.~
@372  = ~(Your lips brush across Tsujatha's only for an instant. Tsujatha looks down into your face and smiles.)~ ~You can be a tantalizing creature, <CHARNAME>. You offer only a taste of what is sweeter than wine: your lips. ~
@373  = ~ (You touch Tsujatha's mouth with a kiss so brief it seems as if he can hardly have noticed it. Tsujatha lets nothing you do escape him, however.) My butterfly. ~
@374  = ~ (You lean up toward Tsujatha and brush his cheek with a light kiss. His eyes brighten immediately.)~
@375  = ~How did you know that I wanted that very thing, my own one? You read me well. ~
@376  = ~ (Tsujatha is bending to look at something. You cannot see what, but the proximity of his face is too much.)~
@377  = ~ (You plant a soft kiss on the end of his aquiline nose. Tsujatha stands up in surprise, and he laughs.)~
@378  = ~You are yet as sweet as a child, my <CHARNAME>.~
@379  = ~(Seizing a relatively quiet moment during your march, you leap into Tsujatha's arms.)~
@380  = ~(He is surprised by your attack, but he catches and holds you without difficulty.)~
@381  = ~The trouble with voluntary surrender, <CHARNAME>, is that you are held at your foe's pleasure.~
@382  = ~And my pleasure in holding you is great enough that I have no intention of letting you go. (He smiles and kisses your nose.)~
@383  = ~ (Tsujatha has just sat down to remove something from his shoe. As he drops a pebble onto the ground, you spring.)~
@384  = ~(You had forgotten how foolish it is to surprise a mage, however, and you find yourself held in place by Tsujatha's magic, unable to move.)~
@385  = ~(Tsujatha's face turns grey with horror, and his eyes fill with remorse; he instantly dispels the enchantment.)~
@386  = ~Ah, my love. I am glad that I cast nothing more dangerous. I do not wish ever to hurt you.~
@387  = ~(He takes you in his arms, and you can feel his chest heaving.)~
@388  = ~ (Tsujatha is standing still, in that deceptively relaxed stance common to warriors.)~
@389  = ~(His eyes are surveying the horizon, searching, you know, for possible dangers. Without warning, you leap into his arms.)~
@390  = ~(He catches you easily, swinging you around. He smiles as he places you on the ground.)~
@391  = ~My own one, you have a talent for giving me exactly what I need at any moment. ~
@392  = ~ (You throw yourself into Tsujatha's arms, and he enfolds you.)~
@393  = ~(He leans his head down toward yours, and his hair falls around you in a silken black curtain.)~
@394  = ~(Using it for a veil he kisses your cheek.) You belong always in my arms, beloved. ~
@395  = ~(Tsujatha watches your undulations with a widening smile.) Well done, dear-heart. (He gives your backside a meaningful caress.) ~
@396  = ~ You have the grace of a dancer, <CHARNAME>. A most arousing display. (He smiles at you with gleaming eyes.) ~
@397  = ~ (Tsujatha winks at you.) Cruel little <CHARNAME>. You ought not to tempt me so when you give me no way to avail myself of those delights. ~
@398  = ~ (Tsujatha laughs softly as he watches you, and when you finish your impromptu dance he applauds.)~
@399  = ~You ought to be on the stage, sweet one. Or perhaps not. I would then have to fight off all your would-be wooers, and I do not think that would leave much time for your quest!~
@400  = ~(Tsujatha speaks lightly, but the jealousy in his tone is real.) ~
@401  = ~ (Tsujatha responds to the brush of your lips against his by crushing you against his chest. His lips cling to yours, refusing to release them.)~ ~(His tongue searches the inside of your mouth, and the feel of his tongue on yours causes your body to shiver in delight and anticipation. You do not end the kiss, leaving it to Tsujatha to do so.)~
@402  = ~(He does not, and it is not until one of the others impatiently jogs you that you fall apart from Tsujatha.) ~
@403  = ~ (Tsujatha's tongue duels with yours in a frenetic yet loving battle that leaves you both breathless. You cannot say who was the victor, but you are both happier for the encounter.) ~
@404  = ~ (Tsujatha bends his head to yours, accepting your kiss. He does not touch you except for your mouth, and you wonder whether your act has pleased him.)~
@405  = ~(When you step away from him, however, you catch a glimpse of his robes and realize just how much pleasure he received.) ~
@406  = ~ (Tsujatha cradles your face as you kiss, and his strong, skilled fingers begin to slide back into your hair.)~
@407  = ~(Your body trembles at the touch, and you melt into his arms. When your kiss ends your knees are weak with desire.) ~
@408  = ~(You have been watching Tsujatha, and he seems graver than usual. You feel a chill in your spine, and you recall a poem you once read in Candlekeep. It seems appropriate now, and you begin to recite, your eyes fixed on Tsujatha's face.) ~
@409  = ~ Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate.
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
My bonds in thee are all determinate. ~
@410  = ~ For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving. ~
@411  = ~ (You get only so far, and Tsujatha interrupts you by placing his finger on your lips.) No, my sweet <CHARNAME>, no. ~
@412  = ~ It is not you, but I who am undeserving. You are the one too precious for such as I, and *Thus I have had thee as a dream doth flatter, In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.*  Nevertheless, even for the dream I thank you.) ~
@413  = ~ (You have been admiring Tsujatha's beautiful profile for some time as you walk, and at last the poem that has been lurking beneath the surface of your thoughts, bubbles up and out.) ~
@414  = ~ Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
Some in their garments, though newfangled ill,
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse...~
@415  = ~ (You suddenly forget the rest as Tsujatha turns to face you. He strokes your cheek with the tip of his finger and takes up the poem.) ~
@416  = ~All these I better in one general best.
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
Of more delight than hawks or horses be; ~
@417  = ~ And having thee, of all men's pride I boast;
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
All this away, and me most wretched make. ~
@418  = ~ (The last two lines he whispers so low that you must strain your ears to catch them.) ~
@419  = ~ (You have been thinking of Irenicus and of your own plight, as well as of Imoen, and you sigh. As you do so, you glance over at Tsujatha, the one who loves you more than you had imagined possible. You find yourself smiling, and you recite some lines of poetry that spring unbidden to your lips.) ~
@420  = ~ Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate; ~
@421  = ~ For thy sweet love rememb'red such wealth brings,
That then I scorn to change my state with kings. ~
@422  = ~ (Tsujatha's eyes have grown large during your recitation, and when you have finished, Tsujatha bows his head and kisses your hand.) ~
@423  = ~ If this is even half true, I shall begin to know fear once more. My love, my love. You are all to me. ~
@424  = ~(You have been thinking of Irenicus and of your own plight, as well as of Imoen, and you sigh. As you do so, you glance over at Tsujatha, the one who loves you more than you had imagined possible. You find yourself smiling, and you recite some lines of poetry that spring unbidden to your lips.) ~
@425  = ~ (You slip up next to Tsujatha and throw your arms around him. He responds with a laugh as he returns your embrace.)~
@426  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is no one like you on any world. ~
@427  = ~ (Tsujatha seems to no longer be paying attention to your surroundings, and a far-off look is in his silver eyes.~
@428  = ~(You feel a sudden need to draw him back into this world, with you, and you put your arms around him as though to keep him from slipping away.)~
@429  = ~(The distant expression instantly vanishes from his face, and he crushes you to him.)~
@430  = ~My beloved. You are my anchor. (The closeness with which he has followed your thoughts no longer surprises you, but you are pleased anew with it.)~
@431  = ~ (Tsujatha has paused in marching to find something in his pack. You creep up behind him and put your arms around him.)~
@432  = ~(He does not move, but breathes deeply, inhaling your scent.)~
@433  = ~The fragrance of a morning-glory, sweet and intoxicating, but fleeting.~
@434  = ~Do not be like that fragile blossom, my love. Do not leave me desolate. ~
@435  = ~ (You are seized with the desire to hug Tsujatha, and you immediately indulge yourself.)~
@436  = ~(In reaction, Tsujatha sweeps you off your feet and carries you. He shows no sign of wanting to put you down, and you settle into his arms.)~
@437  = ~(He marches more than a mile before he releases you, and when you are at last on the ground again you hear his whisper.)~
@438  = ~My dearest, I wish you never had to be out of my arms. ~
@439  = ~(Tsujatha seems to understand your desire to be close to him, and he lovingly strokes your hair as you lean against him.)~
@440  = ~ (For a timeless moment you stand motionless, listening to the even beat of Tsujatha's heart, and you taste peace.) ~
@441  = ~ (You draw comfort from Tsujatha's nearness, and he nuzzles the top of your head.)~
@442  = ~(You hear whispered words in his native tongue. You do not understand any of them, but you catch your own name repeated like an invocation or a blessing.)~
@443  = ~(A shiver travels your body at your realization of the depth of Tsujatha's love for you.) ~
@444  = ~ (Tsujatha's arms slide around you, and you feel him rock you gently back and forth.)~
@445  = ~(You have not felt so safe since you learned of your Bhaalspawn heritage, and a gleam of hope appears in your mind, hope that you and Tsujatha might survive to see a peaceful dawn.)~
@446  = ~ (Tsujatha cradles you in his arms; his hair slides down around you, enclosing you in the silken black veil that you so love.)~
@447  = ~(Hidden behind his hair, you lean up to kiss his chin.) My sweet love.~
@448  = ~(His whisper is for your ears alone, and you treasure the words.) ~
@449  = ~(Tsujatha stops still, his silver eyes glowing in wonder.) It is like a dream to hear you say this, <CHARNAME>, a more beautiful dream than any I have ever had. ~
@450  = ~ My love for you is greater than I can express, <CHARNAME>, but I shall spend the rest of my days trying to prove it to you. ~
@451  = ~ (Tsujatha stares at you in silence, and he seems to have stopped breathing. There is amazement in his eyes, and he catches hold of you.)~
@452  = ~Swear to me that you are not a dream, my love, that I shall not awaken to find that you have returned to the mists of heaven from which you sprang. ~
@453  = ~ I did not know love before I found you, <CHARNAME>.~
@454  = ~For this I shall ever be grateful to the gods of this world, even if they were to strike me dead this moment. ~
@455  = ~(Tsujatha obediently looks at the indicated place in your hair.) Ah yes. Definitely something in it.~
@456  = ~(You feel his fingers in your hair only for a moment, and you are disappointed that your ruse has failed.)~
@457  = ~(Your disappointment lasts only for an instant, however, as he places a morning-glory in your hand.)~
@458  = ~Like attracts like it seems. ~
@459  = ~ (Tsujatha does not answer, but he gently removes your hands from the tangle in your hair.)~
@460  = ~(His nimble fingers make short work of the knotted mess, but he does not cease to explore your hair.)~
@461  = ~(Almost before you realize it, you are leaning back against him; your eyes have closed, and you give yourself over to the pleasure of feeling Tsujatha's touch on your skin.) ~
@462  = ~ (Tsujatha begins to untangle the knot, and he chides you gently.)~
@463  = ~<CHARNAME>, you ought to bind your hair more carefully. Leaving it loose as you do can lead to more serious damage than tangles such as these.~
@464  = ~In battle your hair could be grabbed. You ought to braid it like this.~
@465  = ~(Tsujatha's fingers move deftly through your hair, and when he has finished you find that your hair is now a shining, elaborate triple braid.)~
@466  = ~You see? The women of my nation wear their hair so. It suits you, beloved. ~
@467  = ~ Where? (Tsujatha does not wait for you to answer; before you can, he has spotted the knot.)~
@468  = ~I see. How did you get this so tangled? It looks as though a cat has sucked your head.~
@469  = ~(This remark, delivered in Tsujatha's ever-serious tone, sends you into such gales of laughter that Tsujatha has difficulty untangling the knot.) ~
@470  = ~(Tsujatha's surprise is evident.) Tense? (He suddenly smiles, catching your meaning.)~
@471  = ~If ever you wish to touch me, <CHARNAME>, do so.~
@472  = ~I would greatly enjoy such a pleasure as the feel of your hands on my skin. ~
@473  = ~ (Tsujatha starts, and a look of love settles on his face.)~
@474  = ~Your kindness is without limit, <CHARNAME>. That you would notice such a little thing, and even above that, that you would wish to do me ease...I cannot find the words to speak to you.~
@475  = ~Thank you is not enough. I honor you, my best beloved one. ~
@476  = ~ I would indeed, sweetest of hearts. But be forewarned.~
@477  = ~There is much tension built up in my muscles, and it may take hours to relax me.~
@478  = ~(He smiles playfully, and you realize how rare a moment this is.)~
@479  = ~(You treasure the lightness in his eyes, and you kiss the top of his head as you begin to knead his shoulders.) ~
@480  = ~There is nothing wrong with me that the touch of your hand cannot cure, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@481  = ~(Tsujatha kisses your hand, and you cradle it against his cheek.) ~
@482  = ~(Tsujatha says nothing, but his eyes widen appreciatively; and you can hear the sudden intake of his breath.) ~
@483  = ~ (Tsujatha looks up from your breasts to your eyes. Seeing there the implicit permission he apparently sought, he reaches out to touch your breasts.)~
@484  = ~(His hands, the strong, agile hands of a mage, slide over your breasts. His touch is firm and focused, and the expert manipulation of your nipples nearly leaves you breathless.)~
@485  = ~(At last he releases you and returns to his place in formation. You are left aching for more.) ~
@486  = ~ (Tsujatha unexpectedly grasps you around the waist and hoists you into the air, burying his face in your open blouse.)~
@487  = ~(He holds you there, and you feel his tongue and lips moving from one breast to the other.)~
@488  = ~(When at last he releases you, you find the shape of a rose has been kissed onto your chest. The obviously magical shape flashes gold and then vanishes.) ~
@489  = ~(Tsujatha gives no outward sign that he has even seen your breasts, but suddenly you feel as though his hands are on you.)~
@490  = ~(He has not moved from where he stands, but you feel his gentle touch roving over your breasts.) ~
@491  = ~(Your nipples stiffen at the stimulation, and you feel the familiar ache in your loins at the thought of Tsujatha possessing your body.)~
@492  = ~(He still has not moved, but you recognize the glance of concentration in his eyes and know that he is magically manipulating your breasts.) ~
@493  = ~(You notice his hands making the movements that you feel, despite the distance between you.)~
@494  = ~(Your pleasure is evident, and Tsujatha at last closes the distance between you.) ~
@495  = ~There are advantages in having a magician for a lover.~
@496  = ~(Your searching fingers find their way into Tsujatha's robes with little difficulty. You feel the now-familiar edges of the scar on his chest. You slide your hands downward, below the scar. ~
@497  = ~ By the time your fingers have reached his inner thigh, Tsujatha has stopped moving. His silver eyes bore into your face, and you start back guiltily.) ~
@498  = ~ I am sorry, Tsujatha. ~
@499  = ~ Forgive me, Tsujatha. I forgot myself. ~
@500  = ~But *I* am not. (He takes you into his arms then, and you feel the results of your touch pressing into your side.)~
@501  = ~I think we should set up camp now, my love.~
@502  = ~There is nothing to forgive. (He takes you into his arms then, and you feel the results of your touch pressing into your side.)~
@503  = ~ (You slide your hands into Tsujatha's robes, and he starts back.)~
@504  = ~Your hands are cold, dear one. (He smiles and takes your hands.) Let me warm them for you before we try that again.~
@505  = ~ (Tsujatha's eyes widen as you touch him, and he stops still to better enjoy your caresses.)~
@506  = ~Sweet <CHARNAME>, you are skilled in the arts of love. I shall have to repay you in kind when we make camp.~
@507  = ~(The tantalizing spark in his eyes excites you, and you look forward to the fulfillment of his promise.) ~
@508  = ~ (You hear the sudden intake of Tsujatha's breath as you place your hands on him. He looks down into your eyes, and the silver light of his gaze is twice as bright as usual.)~
@509  = ~(He keeps his eyes fixed on you as you fondle him. Suddenly he closes them and backs away from you.)~
@510  = ~Enough, little one. At least for now. I would not spoil your pleasure this evening. ~
@511  = ~(Tsujatha laughs at your obvious desire, and he kisses you lightly on the cheek.)~
@512  = ~My <CHARNAME>, you may have what you want whenever you choose to make camp. ~
@513  = ~ (Tsujatha smiles at your foolery, and he takes you in his arms.) My sweet little one. How can I refuse you?~
@514  = ~(He bends his head to yours, and his kiss takes away your breath.) ~
@515  = ~What is it that you wish of me, <CHARNAME>? (Tsujatha is obviously teasing, and he takes your hand.)~
@516  = ~Perhaps I can give you the bone that you desire as soon as we make camp. ~
@517  = ~(Tsujatha pretends not to have noticed you, but in your mind you hear the growl of a tiger.)~
@518  = ~(Tsujatha answers your questioning look with a raised eyebrow and a tilt of his head.) ~
@519  = ~(You lean up to kiss Tsujatha on the ear, but he turns toward you just at that moment.)~
@520  = ~(Your kiss lands on his cheek instead, and the wizard smiles.)~
@521  = ~I think you missed. Let us see if I can aim any better. (He leans down to kiss your mouth.) ~
@522  = ~ (You trace the inner edge of Tsujatha's ear with your tongue, and he stops, savoring the feel of you.)~
@523  = ~(He reaches for your hand and presses it. His whole carriage betrays his arousal, and you return to your place, well satisfied with your work.) ~
@524  = ~ (Tsujatha has paused in marching to survey the horizon, and his head is cocked to one side as though listening.)~
@525  = ~(Impulsively, you lean up and kiss his ear. Tsujatha freezes in place, and you begin to nibble the pointed tip.) ~
@526  = ~(The Elf turns to look you in the eye, and the passion in his silver gaze melts your heart and loins.) ~
@527  = ~ Tonight, my love. (His tone is a promise, and you look forward to its fulfillment.) ~
@528  = ~ (With a gesture, you draw Tsujatha to your side. Your face glows as you pull his head down toward you, and you kiss his ear.)~
@529  = ~(As you do so, you whisper the endearments you know he loves.)~
@530  = ~ (Tsujatha shocks you by breaking your grip on him, and he turns you to face him.)~
@531  = ~(His eyes are blazing with raw passion, and he kisses you roughly and hungrily.)~
@532  = ~(When he releases you, your knees are shaking, and your garments are wet from your desire.) ~
@533  = ~(Tsujatha looks at you and smiles.) I am quite skilled in the sorts of massage *you* mean, but I doubt that you get much rest. ~
@534  = ~ (I will be glad to oblige you, <CHARNAME>, but I must warn you that my fees for massage are high.  I will require at least a dozen kisses in exchange. ~
@535  = ~  Perhaps we could barter instead? I could give you a massage, too. ~
@536  = ~ I agree. Will you take your payment now or later? ~
@537  = ~Agreed. Tonight then. (He is aroused by the prospect, as your glance in the appropriate direction reveals.) ~
@538  = ~Now. (He draws near to you and kisses your breath away.) *And* later.~
@539  = ~ Will you now? (There is a lightness to Tsujatha's tone that brings an answering smile to your lips.) ~
@540  = ~I think I might be persuaded to oblige you. The thought of massaging your body, of my hands exploring you, is quite an attractive one, I admit. ~
@541  = ~(Tsujatha gives you a gentle squeeze on your shoulder and slides his hand down your chest as he returns to his place.)~
@542  = ~Just a taste of what is in store for you, little one. ~
@543  = ~ A full body massage? That involves a great deal of time and effort to do properly. I think we ought to set up camp early to leave plenty of time for it. ~
@544  = ~ I promise you that whatever I do will be pleasurable, but I cannot promise how conducive it will be to your sleeping. ~
@545  = ~ (Tsujatha's voice is inviting, and you find yourself tempted to give the order to halt immediately.) ~
@546  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes widen at your earnestness, and he moves over to stand beside you.)~
@547  = ~(Seeing the mute plea in your eyes, he leans into your mouth and kisses you. His passion mounts, as does your own, and he lowers you to the ground.) ~
@548  = ~(Without making camp, without even a glance to see if anyone is observing you, he complies with your request.)~
@549  = ~(Your love-making is intense, and it is not brief.)~
@550  = ~(In fact, it lasts so long that when it is over at last, you are forced to make camp.) ~
@551  = ~ Now, <CHARNAME>? (Tsujatha's glance at your surroundings is eloquent. The intensity of your desire does not escape him, however, and he puts his arms around you.) ~
@552  = ~ Now it shall be. (Tsujatha's love-making does not begin in its usual gentle fashion, but rather he is nearly rough in your love-play; and you respond in kind.) ~
@553  = ~ (When at last you have finished enjoying each other, you see that the scratches you put on his back have drawn blood.) ~
@554  = ~ (Tsujatha takes your hand and raises it to his lips.)~
@555  = ~How can I refuse you anything, my love? Especially not something that I myself so desire. ~
@556  = ~ (He takes you in his arms, and, with a fervor that you have rarely seen, he makes wild love to you.) ~
@557  = ~ (The positions you end up in are beyond anything you have imagined; and you know that you will both be sore later, but as you lie in his arms, utterly spent, you realize that it was worth any amount of soreness. You cannot remember anything like this.) ~
@558  = ~ Your eagerness is arousing, <CHARNAME>. (A downward glance gives the truth of Tsujatha's words, and you smile at his desire for you. As usual, he has followed your thoughts.) ~
@559  = ~ It gives me unimaginable pleasure to know that you desire me as I do you. And I *do* want you. I need you. ~
@560  = ~ (You know that he is speaking of more than the physical sense, and tears start into your eyes.)~
@561  = ~(Your love-making is sweet and gentle, full of deep, rich kisses and lovers' endearments.) ~
@562  = ~(Tsujatha smiles in astonishment.) <CHARNAME>, you would give me such an honor? (At your nod, he leads the way into the bath.) ~
@563  = ~ (The attendants are scurrying to serve you in such a hurried, obsequious fashion that you suspect Tsujatha must have paid well above the going rate for such a bath. This suspicion is confirmed when you realize that you have the entire bath-house to yourselves.) ~
@564  = ~ (Tsujatha is obviously happy, but there is a serious gleam in his eyes. When the attendants have departed, assured that you will call them if they are needed, Tsujatha speaks again.)  ~
@565  = ~ May I undress you, <CHARNAME>? (Again you nod, and Tsujatha begins to slowly remove your garments. When you stand before him, unclothed, he takes you in his arms.) ~
@566  = ~ (His own clothes are gone now as well, and you have an instant to think how pleasant it is to have a mage for a lover before he plunges you both into the steaming water. The heat soothes your travel-weary muscles, and Tsujatha begins to aid the water by massaging your shoulders.)~
@567  = ~ (Before you can speak, he has begun to wash you. The cloth is rough, but his touch is gentle; you find yourself utterly relaxed. You are humbled by Tsujatha's humility. He cares for you as though he were your squire or body-servant.) ~
@568  = ~ (You give yourself over to the peace of the moment. The moment stretches out so long that the water begins to chill. Tsujatha has never ceased his ministrations to you, and now, just as you begin to feel slightly cold, he lifts you from the water.) ~
@569  = ~ (He wraps a large towel, softer and whiter than any you recall seeing in this bath-house, around you. He uses a second towel to dry your hair.) ~
@570  = ~ (Your skin is wrinkled from the water, and you feel very much like a child. Tsujatha understands your feeling, for he takes you up to your room and rocks you to sleep.) ~
@571  = ~(You approach Tsujatha to ask him if he wishes to bathe with you, but he speaks before you can.) Dearest, would you care to bathe...together?~
@572  = ~(At your assent, he leads the way into the bath. The steam rising from the various tubs causes you to speed up. The very thought of a bath is enticing.~
@573  = ~(You quickly remove your clothes and jump into the water. The resulting splash draws a chuckle from Tsujatha. You look up to see him watching you admiringly. You continue to observe as he begins to undress.)~
@574  = ~(His mage robes drop from his body, and you are struck yet again with the development of his physique. Tsujatha has long, cat-like muscles that even a warrior would envy.)~
@575  = ~(Tsujatha slowly eases into the water and slides next to you. He breathes a long sigh of content and closes his eyes. Seeing him so defenseless you cannot help yourself. You splash his face.)~
@576  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes flutter open, and he smiles.) You will pay for that, <CHARNAME>. (Tsujatha splashes you in return, and before you realize it, you are in a full-scale water fight.)~
@577  = ~(Half the water in your tub is lost before you recover yourselves. Tsujatha shakes his head.) I do not know when I have ever played so much. You have given me something most precious, beloved.~
@578  = ~(Tsujatha has resumed his serious look, and he takes your hand.) Thank you. (There is not enough water left to properly bathe, so the two of you slip out and dress quickly.)~
@579  = ~(You are left with the feeling that for Tsujatha there is nothing frivolous. Everything, even a water fight, is serious to him in the end.)~
@580  = ~ (Tsujatha glances around the establishment.) Hardly a fit place to bathe, <CHARNAME>. But do not worry. I can take care of that. ~
@581  = ~ (You are not at first sure of what he means, but when you enter the bath, you understand. The rough wood of the tub, the shabby cloths, the hard slivers of soap, all vanish before your eyes. ~
@582  = ~ In their place is an enormous tub of ivory, cloths of the whitest, freshest linen, and enormous cakes of soft, white soap. The steaming water is full of bubbles, and Tsujatha smiles at your pleasure.) ~
@583  = ~ It will not last very long, but long enough for us. (There is enough room for you both to stretch out, and you thoroughly enjoy it. You lie luxuriating in the water, and your eyes begin to grow heavy.) ~
@584  = ~(You are quickly aroused from your drowsy state, however, by Tsujatha leaning in to kiss you.) ~
@585  = ~ You look like a Queen, my love. These are the surroundings that are suited to you. The rough roads that you are forced to travel are not suited to your beauty. ~
@586  = ~ (Now aroused in more ways than one, you put your arms around Tsujatha's neck and pull him toward you again. His admiration for your unclothed body has already impassioned him, and he responds to your advances with alacrity.) ~
@587  = ~ (Making love to Tsujatha in the water is an exhilarating experience, and it is one you are resolved to repeat.) ~
@588  = ~(Tsujatha has drawn apart from the rest, and a glance at his open pack tells you where he has gone. You are seized with the desire to do something for Tsujatha, and you go to the water.) ~
@589  = ~ (You see him floating on the surface, and you pause a moment to appreciate the view. Tsujatha's gold skin contrasts with the calm blue of the water, and you notice particularly the long scar on his chest.) ~
@590  = ~ (It runs from just below his clavicle to just below his navel. You silently undress and slip into the water, carrying one of your own bathing cloths. You glide over to where Tsujatha is peacefully floating, and you begin to wash him, softly rubbing the cloth across his chest.) ~
@591  = ~ (Tsujatha opens his eyes at your touch, and he smiles wonderingly.) I am dreaming, am I not?  This is not real.  It cannot be. ~
@592  = ~  It cannot be that such sweetness, such gentleness are for me. (The kiss you give him apparently fails to reassure him of your reality, for he stands up and puts his arms around you.) ~
@593  = ~ Do not leave me. (You remain in the water for so long that you both begin to chill, but Tsujatha seems reluctant to leave. At last you are forced to return to your campfire, and as you leave the water you catch a whisper behind you.) It was a dream. ~
@594  = ~ (You take Tsujatha's hand and draw him toward the water. You strip quickly and plunge in. Tsujatha removes his clothes more slowly, seeming struck by the sight of you gliding through the water.) ~
@595  = ~ (In fact, by the time he does join you in the water, you have already completely washed. Tsujatha seems uninterested in actually bathing, for he immediately draws near to you.) ~
@596  = ~ For you, my Lady and my Queen. (He places on your head a crown of flowers; you realize that this was what had delayed him. You reach up to feel the flowers, and you pull one loose to look at it.) ~
@597  = ~ (It is a type of flower you have never seen before. Small and star-shaped, its white shows all the more vividly against the blue of the water; its scent is sweet, almost heady, and you know that you have never in all your travels seen anything like this.)  ~
@598  = ~ It is orlahnna. It is native to my world. It blooms only at night, and it is treasured as the flower of lovers. ~
@599  = ~ It reminds me of you, for your goodness shows up more clearly than ever in the darkness of your surroundings. ~
@600  = ~ (Tsujatha takes your hand as you leave the water, and you do not remove the crown of flowers from your head; it remains untouched until the spell expires.) ~
@601  = ~ (You have withdrawn to bathe, and you find yourself wishing you had brought Tsujatha with you. Even as the thought enters your mind, you hear footsteps behind you.) ~
@602  = ~ It is I, Lady-love. (Tsujatha's voice is unexpectedly diffident.)  May I join you? ~
@603  = ~ (At your nod of assent, Tsujatha quickly strips and dives into the water. He swims about, enjoying the view as you wash yourself. You smile inwardly, knowing what effect the sight of your nude body will have on Tsujatha.) ~
@604  = ~ (You slow the pace of your washing, allowing Tsujatha longer and longer looks. His splashing slowly decreases, and you feel the ripples of the water as he approaches.) ~
@605  = ~ (You release your hair from its bond, and you hear the sudden intake of Tsujatha's breath. Without a word, he takes the soap from your hand and begins to lather it through your hair.) ~
@606  = ~ (You relax into his touch as he massages your scalp. At last, and yet it still seems too soon to you, he rinses your hair. When he has finished, he turns you around to face him.) ~
@607  = ~ (Your hair hangs about your face in heavy, dripping locks, and Tsujatha smiles as you.)  Have you no reward to offer your faithful squire, Lady? ~
@608  = ~ (For answer you put your arms around him and kiss him. His excitement at seeing your naked form has not waned during his washing of your hair, and you find you now match his rising ardor.) ~
@609  = ~ (Tsujatha murmurs a few words, and then he pulls you below the surface of the water. You find that either you need no air, or else you can breathe the water, for your lungs do not rebel.) ~
@610  = ~ (The surface of the water first ripples, then bubbles, then churns as your passion takes its course. When at last you and Tsujatha emerge from the water, you are both cleaner and more relaxed, but you must admit that you are more tired than before your bath.) ~
@611  = ~(Your eyes travel over Tsujatha's form, and you smile possessively, though you have not yet possessed him. Your heart thrills to his mere presence.)~
@612  = ~Tsujatha, could you help me with my hair?  I've gotten something tangled in it. ~
@613  = ~(He says nothing, but neither does he release you until you move.) ~
@614  = ~ (Tsujatha raises your hand to lips and briefly kisses it. He does not let go of your hand when he lowers it, however, and you walk hand-in-hand for some time.) ~
@615  = ~ (Tsujatha intertwines his fingers with yours, and he looks down at you in delight.) I was desirous of your touch. Thank you, my heart. ~
@616  = ~ (The feel of Tsujatha's hand in your is inexpressibly comforting, and you walk on, feeling safer than you would have imagined possible, considering your circumstances.) ~
@617  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes darken.) My past before I met you, Lady-love, is not a pleasant thing. I would rather forget it. For me, my life began the day I saw your face.) ~
@618  = ~ What would you know, <CHARNAME>? I grew up in a tiny village not far from the borders of our desert land.~
@619  = ~I was mocked by the other children, until I learned to harness the Mir--magic...in my blood.~
@620  = ~It was not a pleasant life. ~
@621  = ~ Would you hear of my past adventures? I have fought Nohr...a kind of giant...and Men.~
@622  = ~It was in Halchek that I dwelt after Sillara's departure to marry Lord Kan-Terak. ~
@623  = ~ (Tsujatha smiles suddenly at you.) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You have reminded me of the joy I have gained here in Faerun. It is the sweetest of all joys, that of release from sorrow.~
@624  = ~ Even if you had given me no other gift, the gift of freedom from the weight of jealousy and thwarted revenge would be treasure enough to make me love you the rest of my days. ~
@625  = ~ (My past is dark, my fair one. I have killed often. Sometimes it was blameless in me; I have fought for my life as often as you have for yours. ~
@626  = ~ Other times it was not. I have killed men for being in my way. I have killed men for crossing me. ~
@627  = ~ (Tsujatha's eyes narrow as he looks into your face.) Say that you forgive me, best beloved one. I need to hear that you can look past this to love me.~
@628  = ~(Your lips brush across Tsujatha's only for an instant. Tsujatha looks down into your face and smiles.)~
@629  = ~You can be a tantalizing creature, <CHARNAME>. You offer only a taste of what is sweeter than wine: your lips. ~
@630  = ~(You plant a soft kiss on the end of his aquiline nose. Tsujatha stands up in surprise, and he laughs.)~
@631  = ~You are yet as sweet as a child, my <CHARNAME>. ~
@632  = ~And my pleasure in holding you is great enough that I have no intention of letting you go. (He smiles and kisses your nose.) ~
@633  = ~(He takes you in his arms, and you can feel his chest heaving.) ~
@634  = ~ (Tsujatha is standing still, in that deceptively relaxed stance common to warriors. His eyes are surveying the horizon, searching, you know, for possible dangers.)~
@635  = ~(Without warning, you leap into his arms. He catches you easily, swinging you around. He smiles as he places you on the ground.)~
@636  = ~(He leans his head down toward yours, and his hair falls around you in a silken black curtain. Using it for a veil he kisses your cheek.)~
@637  = ~You belong always in my arms, beloved. ~
@638  = ~ (Tsujatha responds to the brush of your lips against his by crushing you against his chest. His lips cling to yours, refusing to release them.)~
@639  = ~(His tongue searches the inside of your mouth, and the feel of his tongue on yours causes your body to shiver in delight and anticipation. You do not end the kiss, leaving it to Tsujatha to do so.)~
@640  = ~(You have been admiring Tsujatha's beautiful profile for some time as you walk, and at last the poem that has been lurking beneath the surface of your thoughts, bubbles up and out.) ~
@641  = ~ (Tsujatha seems to no longer be paying attention to your surroundings, and a far-off look is in his silver eyes.)~
@642  = ~My beloved. You are my anchor. (The closeness with which he has followed your thoughts no longer surprises you, but you are pleased anew with it.) ~
@643  = ~(For a timeless moment you stand motionless, listening to the even beat of Tsujatha's heart, and you taste peace.) ~
@644  = ~(You have not felt so safe since you learned of your Bhaalspawn heritage, and a gleam of hope appears in your mind, hope that you and Tsujatha might survive to see a peaceful dawn.) ~
@645  = ~(Tsujatha stops still, his silver eyes glowing in wonder.)~
@646  = ~It is like a dream to hear you say this, <CHARNAME>, a more beautiful dream than any I have ever had. ~
@647  = ~ (Tsujatha stares at you in silence, and he seems to have stopped breathing.)~
@648  = ~(There is amazement in his eyes, and he catches hold of you.)~
@649  = ~(Almost before you realize it, you are leaning back against him; your eyes have closed, and you give yourself over to the pleasure of feeling Tsujatha's touch on your skin.)~
@650  = ~You see?  The women of my nation wear their hair so. It suits you, beloved. ~
@651  = ~(This remark, delivered in Tsujatha's ever-serious tone, sends you into such gales of laughter that Tsujatha has difficulty untangling the knot.)~
@652  = ~ (Tsujatha's surprise is evident.) Tense? (He suddenly smiles, catching your meaning.)~
@653  = ~If ever you wish to touch me, <CHARNAME>, do so. I would greatly enjoy such a pleasure as the feel of your hands on my skin. ~
@654  = ~(He smiles playfully, and you realize how rare a moment this is. You treasure the lightness in his eyes, and you kiss the top of his head as you begin to knead his shoulders.) ~
@655  = ~(There is nothing wrong with me that the touch of your hand cannot cure, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~
@656  = ~(Tsujatha kisses your hand, and you cradle it against his cheek.)~
@657  = ~You will not hurt <CHARNAME>. I will not allow it.~
@658  = ~(Bodhi ignores Tsujatha and continues to address you.)~
@659  = ~And there is also something else of yours that I would take.~
@660  = ~This lovely, golden Elf here--yours to his core--I shall take for my own. He shall serve me against you.~
@661  = ~In that, vampire, you are wrong.~
@662  = ~The mages of *my* world cannot be taken against their will, for the magic in our blood can always be turned inward.~
@663  = ~I shall *not* injure <CHARNAME>, now or ever.~
@664  = ~Your sister has been murdered. Anomen, there is no choice in this matter. You must take vengeance. If you do not, then you dishonor her memory. I do not think that you are strong enough to live with this guilt and its accompanying pain.~
@665  = ~Anomen, I can no longer endure this.~
@666  = ~I have watched in silence so long as I could, but this is too much.~
@667  = ~Tsujatha? What is it? What have I done?~
@668  = ~This is not right. You hold Lady <CHARNAME>'s feelings in such low esteem that you would lash out at her in words of cruelty.~
@669  = ~Yet your eyes continue to follow her, and you wish to take advantage of her good nature to regain her favor.~
@670  = ~It is wrong of you, priest.~
@671  = ~Tsujatha? (Anomen seems truly astonished, for Tsujatha's words to him have never been less than kind.)~
@672  = ~Why would you say this?~
@673  = ~Because it is the truth.~
@674  = ~(A sudden flash appears in Anomen's dark eyes.)~
@675  = ~No, it is because *you* desire the lady for yourself!~
@676  = ~(Tsujatha ignores Anomen's words.)~
@677  = ~You are unkind to Lady <CHARNAME>, and it is wrong that you should not suffer for it.~
@678  = ~But I *do* suffer. I feel dreadful about my outbursts. My temper has ever been able to get the better of me.~
@679  = ~As has mine of me. (There is a dangerous gleam in Tsujatha's eyes, and Anomen shifts his weight from one foot to the other.)~
@680  = ~Yet I cannot allow you to use Lady <CHARNAME> in this fashion. She shall not be your confessor.~
@681  = ~She shall not be your goddess and your idol, not while I can prevent it.~
@682  = ~And how can you prevent it? (Anomen's bearded chin juts out defiantly.)~
@683  = ~By your death.~
@684  = ~You would do this?~
@685  = ~(There is surprise in Anomen's face, and he looks uneasily at you.)~
@686  = ~Aye, for her sake, I would.~
@687  = ~(Tsujatha's gaze is fixed determinedly on Anomen's visage, and the wizard does not even look at you.)~
@688  = ~Then let us do battle for the sake of <CHARNAME>.~
@689  = ~Yes. Now.~
@690  = ~No, this is not necessary. I will not have it.~
@691  = ~Very well, if this is the only way to make peace between you, do what you must.~
@692  = ~It is necessary.  He glances at Anomen, and the young warrior-priest nods in agreement.)~
@693  = ~I cannot endure a rival, and Anomen cannot endure an insult to his pride.~
@694  = ~But, Tsujatha, you have no rival. I am only a friend to Anomen, nothing more.~
@695  = ~I have romantic interest in only one person in this group, and it is not either of you.~
@696  = ~Tsujatha, I am your friend, but I can be nothing more than this to you. My heart lies with Anomen.~
@697  = ~Very well. (He smiles in purest joy.)~
@698  = ~Anomen, I will now apologize if it is necessary to assuage your wounded pride.~
@699  = ~(Anomen responds only with a gesture, and Tsujatha whispers to you.)~
@700  = ~It is best to leave him be. He has had enough humiliation for today.~
@701  = ~Very well.~
@702  = ~(Tsujatha turns to go back to his place in formation, but he thinks better of it and continues walking until he is out of sight.)~
@703  = ~I see, Lady. If it is your will, it shall be so.~
@704  = ~Anomen, she is yours. Apologize for your temper if you will, but I think such words are unnecessary now.~
@705  = ~Good. Let us begin. For the honor of my Lady <CHARNAME>, I shall slay you, Anomen Delryn.~
@706  = ~But they *are* necessary. My lady, please allow me to ask your forgiveness.~
@707  = ~This man runs an inn, but his manner toward his customers is harsh at best.~
@708  = ~All here is not what it seems. He must be supplementing his income somehow.~
@709  = ~I was not speaking to you, overgrown Elf.~
@710  = ~You see? There is no justice to be had...unless you mete it out yourself. Choose wisely, Anomen. This choice is one you must live with for the rest of your days.~
@711  = ~A Vampire? <CHARNAME>, I care not whether you accept this offer or no, but you must be aware that either choice involves risk.~
@712  = ~Vampires make dangerous foes, but they make equally dangerous allies. This Bodhi will betray us as likely as not, or feed on us just for sport.~
@713  = ~However, she will certainly attempt these things if we refuse her.  The choice is yours.~
@714  = ~As I suspected, it is a fresh offer from the thief to keep us from defecting.~
@715  = ~Do as you will, <CHARNAME>. It is of no matter to me.~
@716  = ~A knife in the back or fangs at the neck, one or the other is our choice. We gain an enemy no matter which we choose.~
@717  = ~(The boy looks blankly at Tsujatha, then turns back to you.)~
@718  = ~So, what about it?~
@719  = ~(Tsujatha's face is white with rage, but his voice is even as he speaks.)~
@720  = ~Lord Keldorn, there is no choice to be made. This woman has made a mockery of the most sacred of vows.~
@721  = ~She is not worthy to bear the title of woman let alone that of Lady Firecam!~
@722  = ~Your honor, your gods demand justice. You must allow the law to take its course.  Or else slay her yourself. And her lover.~
@723  = ~You...you bastard. Wait...that is the name that you left to be bestowed on your child; your child lawfully conceived in wedlock was left to bear the shame of bastardy. (Tsujatha smiles as Cernd cringes slightly.)~
@724  = ~Obviously, we are being watched. Ask him if you like, but I doubt he will admit it. Regardless, a fresh offer from the thief to make sure we do not defect to the vampires.~
@725  = ~This child is all that is left of your wife, Cernd. Do by him what you ought to have done for his mother.~
@726  = ~So she is gone? (Tsujatha smiles, pleased.)~
@727  = ~Is it necessary that we retrieve her? Surely she could do the most good for the poor rabble in the prisons by staying amongst them?~
@728  = ~And if she is as skilled in picking locks as she claims, she surely need not remain in prison? It seems clear that we need do nothing.~
@729  = ~(Tsujatha's eyebrows rise, and he turns to face the young woman.)~
@730  = ~<CHARNAME> is *not* a yummy little woman. She is a Lady far beyond your comprehension.~
@731  = ~Do not presume to speak to her again.~
@732  = ~<CHARNAME> is *not* a yummy little woman. She is a Lady--*my* Lady--and she is far beyond your comprehension.~
@733  = ~(Tsujatha shrugs.) So the mighty necromancer is dead, and of old age. He had much to learn. There is power in necromancy to cheat death for millennia. As for his suffering, it was no more than he had deserved. Justice will always find you out.~
@734  = ~After all this, she turns back to her wedded lord? What else did you expect, little gnome?~
@735  = ~She would not have before because of your poverty, and you have not gained in riches despite your kindness to her.~
@736  = ~She will use you all your days. That you permit it means you must deserve it.~
@737  = ~<CHARNAME>, be wary. This wizard is toying with magicks beyond his ability.~
@738  = ~Your goodness has brought you to this, Mistress Jaheira. I am sorry for it.~
@739  = ~(There is no mockery in Tsujatha's voice, only genuine pity. Jaheira seems to recognize this, and she weakly smiles in response.)~
@740  = ~I am pleased to see you well, Mistress Jaheira.~
@741  = ~(You look to Tsujatha for a trace of sarcasm in his voice, but there is none. He seems genuinely pleased at Jaheira's release from the curse.)~
@742  = ~A Shadow Dragon? <CHARNAME>, be careful. This is one of the deadliest of all wyrms. His breath will drain away your very life.~
@743  = ~We must aid Lady Fentan. <CHARNAME>, we must not let this misdeed go unpunished.~
@744  = ~We must find and destroy the one responsible for this outrage.~
@745  = ~You betray <CHARNAME> for the sake of your miserable little life?~
@746  = ~<CHARNAME> has been kind to you, has fought for you and with you, and *this* is how you repay <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@747  = ~You are unworthy of life, for you have forsaken the honor which made it worth living.~
@748  = ~Die slowly. You cannot die well.~
@749  = ~Who is this man? Why is *he* to be the judge of <CHARNAME>?~
@750  = ~How has he earned such a right? Mistress Jaheira, your actions are suspect. Explain yourself.~
@751  = ~Speak not to Lady <CHARNAME>, beast! You say her name again at your peril.~
@752  = ~All right! I will not. She's not worth dying for.~
@753  = ~You think not?~
@754  = ~Speak not to Lady <CHARNAME>, beast! She is mine, and you speak to her at peril of your life.~
@755  = ~All right! I will not speak to her. She is not worth dying for.~
@756  = ~That is where he is wrong.~
@757  = ~You look to Tsujatha, this alien companion of your journeys, and you hesitate. At last you speak.~
@758  = ~What do you say, Tsujatha? Shall we take vengeance on Irenicus?~
@759  = ~Tsujatha, this is not your fight. You ought to go back to Gilalion while you still can.~
@760  = ~Please, Tsujatha, stay with me. I need you in this fight.~
@761  = ~I say that Irenicus has injured you and insulted me with his presumption. I am with you, <CHARNAME>. Let us go. Together we shall take payment for this debt from Irenicus' hide.~
@762  = ~Perhaps you are right. It is not my place. Unless you would ask me for aid, of course.~
@763  = ~I need you in this fight, Tsujatha. Stay with me.~
@764  = ~My need is not so great as to keep you here when your own world beckons. Go home, Tsujatha.~
@765  = ~So be it. I had not thought you such a fool, <CHARNAME>, but it ill becomes me to argue with a fool. Go to hell, and join Irenicus there.~
@766  = ~You have been a strong leader, <CHARNAME>. I will go with you and aid you.~
@767  = ~Irenicus has injured you and has insulted me with his presumption. Let us go and force him to pay his debt with blood.~
@768  = ~I came into this world to find the Riose Sar.  I have not yet found it, and your quest presses you on. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@769  = ~You are correct, but it is not to Gilalion that I will go. I yet seek the Riose Sar.~
@770  = ~I journeyed with you to find it, but you refused to obtain it. Go to hell, and join Irenicus there.~
@771  = ~I am afraid not, <CHARNAME>. My own quest, neglected to join with you, still presses. Our ways part here.~
@772  = ~(With a slight bow, Tsujatha is gone.~
@773  = ~You look to Tsujatha, this alien Elf whom you love, and you do not know what to say.~
@774  = ~Tsujatha--~
@775  = ~No, Lady-love. (Tsujatha places his finger on your lips.) Do not speak.~
@776  = ~I know that you would protect me, have me stay back from this most dangerous battle. But I cannot.~
@777  = ~How could I leave my love alone to fight the dark?~
@778  = ~(The thought of Irenicus venting his wrath on Tsujatha flashes across your mind, and you hesitate. Tsujatha sees that you are not yet convinced.)~
@779  = ~My life is bound up in yours, <CHARNAME>. Without you I have nothing, nothing at all. Know that whatever comes, we shall meet it together.~
@780  = ~(He lifts your hand and tenderly kisses it.)~
@781  = ~ Enough. Let us go, beloved. Together we shall face the night.~
@782  = ~I came into this world to seek the Riose Sar. I have not yet found it, but I have found that which I value more even than the heirloom of my house.~
@783  = ~She sees through all the Planes? If she can see my father's dwelling, she is indeed to be pitied.~
@784  = ~The pomposity of madness is indeed astonishing.~
@785  = ~Tsujatha turns to look at you, and jealousy has flamed in his eyes.~
@786  = ~Don't worry, Tsujatha. I would never do something like that.~
@787  = ~Oh don't be so uptight, Tsujatha. A little full-body massage never hurt anyone.~
@788  = ~(Tsujatha's relief is evident, and he furtively presses your hand.) Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It is...reassuring to hear you speak so.~
@789  = ~Is it to be this way, then? Am I to be forced to stand by while the hands of other men play over your body?~
@790  = ~Not likely. Fare you well. You shall not see me more.~
@791  = ~So you have become the owner of a playhouse? It is fitting, I suppose, for a--bard, is it?~
@792  = ~Yet I think that we will find it a burden before all is done.~
@793  = ~And? What is your decision?~
@794  = ~A fine keep. It is good to have a place of refuge and security, and this one can be well-defended.~
@795  = ~It would be a wise decision, <CHARNAME>.  There would be one place in this land where we could be sure of safety.~
@796  = ~<CHARNAME>? (Tsujatha seems hesitant to approach you.)~
@797  = ~Yes, Tsujatha?~
@798  = ~You, too? You would turn away from me now? Not that I blame you.~
@799  = ~Just leave me alone. I need time.~
@800  = ~ I wanted you to know that I am here, <CHARNAME>, at your side.~
@801  = ~ I know that you are good. I will give you whatever aid I can.~
@802  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. It means much to me to hear this. It is so difficult to fight the darkness within me--and now that I lack my own soul-- ~
@803  = ~There is nothing you can do to help me, but I thank you for the offer nonetheless.~
@804  = ~Thank you for your kindness, Tsujatha. I think I need some time alone now, but I will call you if I need you.~
@805  = ~(Tsujatha takes your hand. He seems almost to want to put his arms around you, but he does not.)~
@806  = ~I am here, <CHARNAME>. (There is some comfort for you in his words, and still more in his touch.)~
@807  = ~(You relax slightly and continue to hold Tsujatha's hand in silence.)~
@808  = ~(Tsujatha is obviously saddened by your words, but he does not object.)~
@809  = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. I will go. But I shall not be far.~
@810  = ~(He briefly presses your hand, and there is comfort for you in his touch.)~
@811  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. (Tsujatha is opening and closing his right hand as he speaks, and there is pain in his voice.)~
@812  = ~I am so sorry. It is wrong, *wrong* that one such as you should suffer so.~
@813  = ~I will be here if you should need anything-anything at all.~
@814  = ~(Tsujatha approaches you and takes you in his arms, cradling you against his chest.)~
@815  = ~<CHARNAME>. (He speaks your name as a caress, and he says nothing more.)~
@816  = ~(Be silent, enjoying his embrace.)~
@817  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. I need you now.~
@818  = ~(Pull away from him.) I need some time to be alone now.~
@819  = ~(Tsujatha begins to stroke your hair, murmuring soft words into it.)~
@820  = ~(For a time these words are in his own tongue, but at last you hear words you understand.)~
@821  = ~I am here, always here. You are not alone. You need never be alone.~
@822  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. It means more to me than I can say to hear these words.~
@823  = ~Tsujatha-I have no soul. How can you still be with me? How can you love me?~
@824  = ~Did you not see what I became? How can you stay with me knowing that I might kill you? I have no more control over the taint of Bhaal within me. How can you love me? ~
@825  = ~(I will not leave, <CHARNAME>. I cannot imagine the struggle within you, but I know, I *know* that you are good.~
@826  = ~You will survive, and we--I shall make Irenicus PAY.~
@827  = ~(Passion shakes Tsujatha's voice, and his hand on your hair trembles for an instant.)~
@828  = ~I feel hollow inside, Tsujatha. There is no goodness left in me.~
@829  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha. Hold me. Let me feel your strength. I need you now.~
@830  = ~I shall always love you, <CHARNAME>. My heart is yours, as is my soul.~
@831  = ~And if my soul can save you, you shall have it.~
@832  = ~(Tsujatha kisses your palm and places your open hand over his heart and covers it with his own hand.)~
@833  = ~This I swear on my life. (He places both your hand and his over your own heart.)~
@834  = ~And I swear it on what is infinitely more dear to me, *your* life. My love. My only love.~
@835  = ~But I feel so hollow inside, Tsujatha. There is no goodness left in me.~
@836  = ~Tsujatha, that is beautiful.~
@837  = ~I feel safer, somehow, with you. I need you, Tsujatha.~
@838  = ~It is *not you*, <CHARNAME>. It is NOT. The taint of Bhaal is not what you are.~
@839  = ~I have seen what you are, and you are good. You will survive this, and we--I shall make Irenicus PAY.~
@840  = ~There is. Irenicus may have taken your soul, but he has not yet defiled you.~
@841  = ~There is strength left in you and goodness also. The pain and loss you feel I cannot comprehend, but I would give my own heart, my own soul to do you ease.~
@842  = ~Do not fear. You will not be alone in the struggle. Bhaal himself cannot taint you.~
@843  = ~You are <CHARNAME>, and you are *good*. Ah my love, rest now. Let me watch over you.~
@844  = ~Yes, Tsujatha, please. (Kiss him lightly.) Thank you.~
@845  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha, but not now. I must press on. But I will not forget your kindness. (Kiss him lightly.) Thank you.~
@846  = ~I cannot express to you all that I feel, all that is in my heart. This will have to suffice.~
@847  = ~(He leans into your mouth and kisses you, a kiss at once passionate and sweet, so long that you forget for a moment what you have become.)~
@848  = ~My <CHARNAME>, my love, my life. I will be with you, whatever comes.~
@849  = ~You need me? (There is incredulous joy in Tsujatha's voice.)~
@850  = ~You do me too much honor, beloved. But you shall not look to me in vain. Not now, not ever.~
@851  = ~(He seals his words with a kiss on your brow, and he holds you for long afterward.)~
@852  = ~You need me? (Tsujatha repeats the words incredulously.)~
@853  = ~I am honored. (Tsujatha begins kissing the crown of your head.)~
@854  = ~My love, my <CHARNAME>. I shall always be with you. Nothing will ever be able to separate us.~
@855  = ~The last drop of my heart's-blood is yours, and I vow that I shall give my life to protect you, even from the Slayer within.~
@856  = ~There is no way for you to protect me from myself, Tsujatha. But your vows are not in vain. I will be able to draw from your strength.~
@857  = ~Knowing that you are by my side gives me courage, Tsujatha, courage to face even Irenicus.~
@858  = ~I am glad, Tsujatha, even in the midst of this darkness without and within me, knowing that you are here.~
@859  = ~You have all my strength, all of myself. I lay my life at your feet, <CHARNAME>.~
@860  = ~You are yourself all my life.  Together we shall defeat Irenicus, though we had to chase him into Hell itself!~
@861  = ~(Tsujatha's fire gives you renewed courage, and you know that you will be able to go on.)~
@862  = ~We shall defeat him.~
@863  = ~Being flayed alive is too good for him, and if I had a thousand years in which to devise his tortures, it would not be enough.~
@864  = ~Beloved, that anyone should hurt you in any way is insupportable, but this--~
@865  = ~(Words fail Tsujatha, and he looks into your eyes with such a burning ferocity of love that you cannot help but be comforted.)~
@866  = ~Thank you, Tsujatha.  I am glad that you are with me.~
@867  = ~We can defeat Irenicus, Tsujatha, because I have your strength with me.~
@868  = ~You are all in all to me. There are no words to express my heart. This will have to suffice.~
@869  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes are pained as he steps away from you.) Please, <CHARNAME>.~
@870  = ~Let me help you.  I want to stay near you, to comfort you.~
@871  = ~There is nothing that you can do. I need some time alone now.~
@872  = ~Did you not see what I became? How can you stay with me knowing that I might kill you? I have no more control over the taint of Bhaal within me. How can you love me?~
@873  = ~(Looking into Tsujatha's face you relent, and you realize that you are glad for his presence.) Thank you, Tsujatha. Let me feel your strength; I need you now.~
@874  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. (Tsujatha withdraws, and he is silent, watching you with glowing, suffering eyes.)~
@875  = ~(You know that he endures separation from you as an added pain, joined with the agony of seeing you in torment.)~
@876  = ~(You regret sending him away, but you cannot call him back now.)~
@877  = ~(You rest, however, in the assurance that his love will overlook your thoughtlessness.)~
@878  = ~So that is what lies within your soul, <CHARNAME>?~
@879  = ~It must make for an interesting life, always to be keeping *that* at bay.~
@880  = ~You have given me cause to rejoice, <CHARNAME>, that I no longer enjoy the *favor* of your affection.~
@881  = ~(Tsujatha's voice is cutting, and the glint in his silver eyes is hard and bitter.)~
@882  = ~To be the owner of this sphere is to possess great power, <CHARNAME>.~
@883  = ~And a place of refuge is always good. At least this one is a place with which I am familiar.~
@884  = ~...I...I wish I had...had...  ah...~
@885  = ~So your order has at last recognized the power you possess.~
@886  = ~You are strong with your god, and it is only fitting that you should be accepted into the temple in such wise.~
@887  = ~It is also good to have a place to which we can retreat at need.~
@888  = ~So, what say you to this privilege?~
@889  = ~You have become the guardian of this region, <CHARNAME>. It is what I would have expected from one such as you.~
@890  = ~It is not necessarily the wisest of choices, as you have taken on heavy responsibilities. Yet it is the right thing to do.~
@891  = ~(Tsujatha speaks calculatingly. You know that he does not approve of your choice and would never have taken this decision himself, but he admires it nevertheless.)~
@892  = ~You have been honored, <CHARNAME>. (Tsujatha speaks with admiration and respect.)~
@893  = ~Your heart is pure and your deeds righteous. It is right that you should dwell here, amongst those whose hearts are like yours.~
@894  = ~You will forgive me if I do not feel especially comfortable here.~
@895  = ~(A shadow flits across Tsujatha's face as he speaks, and he says no more.)~
@896  = ~It is an honor, <CHARNAME>, and we hope you view it as such.~
@897  = ~This is a mistake, <CHARNAME>. This is a responsibility and an association that you can ill-afford.~
@898  = ~(You glance sharply at Tsujatha, and he reads your meaning accurately.)~
@899  = ~It is not something that I will leave over, <CHARNAME>. Yet I still think it is not a wise choice.~
@900  = ~To accept this bond is to tie yourself to this grove forever, <CHARNAME>. Be careful.~
@901  = ~Still, it is wise to have a refuge, and as you are a druid, there is no more fitting place--for you.~
@902  = ~(Tsujatha shrugs.) I do not enjoy it, but it is safe at any rate.~
@903  = ~You *dare* to insult Lady <CHARNAME>?~
@904  = ~Fool. Elves make dangerous foes. Now you shall die.~
@905  = ~You devil! You fiend! I hate you all!~
@906  = ~(Tsujatha's eyes are silver ice, and he locks his gaze with Irenicus.)~
@907  = ~I will rip your soul apart and pour out the blood of your life as an offering to <CHARNAME>.~
@908  = ~This, this is the end of all you have striven for. Taste death--and defeat. For the sake of my <CHARNAME>, you shall be destroyed, and your unnatural days shall end in failure.~
@909  = ~Again? Do you not know yet when you have failed? How many times must we slay you?~
@910  = ~Here, in the Abyss, you shall fall at last and taste the defeat you fear.~
@911  = ~Your power is strong indeed, <CHARNAME>. You drew me here through death. A most--disturbing experience.~
@912  = ~It seems, therefore, you yet have need of me. What is it that awaits us here?~
@913  = ~My love? Yes, death did not part us. I felt you slipping away, and I found that I could follow you.~
@914  = ~(Tsujatha takes your hand.) You needed me, <CHARNAME>; you drew me to you, and with all my heart I answered your call.~
@915  = ~So this is our foe after all. A Dragon. I should have known.~
@916  = ~This devious deceit reminds me of the wyrms I have known in the past.~
@917  = ~<CHARNAME>, a word? Dragons are mighty indeed. It would take only one to lay waste to this entire nation.~
@918  = ~But I have battled a Dragon before. There is something I can do to aid you in this battle.~
@919  = ~(Tsujatha lays his hands on you.)You are now immune to anything that he can do to you, whether through his breath or his spells, but it will last only a short time.~
@920  = ~Go! Fight him NOW!!!~
@921  = ~So they have bred Elves with Giants now? How dare you pollute this city with your presence!~
@922  = ~You judge me as evil because I am an Elf?~
@923  = ~My foolish human, you should have waited until *after* I had given you cause.~
@924  = ~It would not have taken long. But then, you would be dead, and it would have been too late.~
@925  = ~You monster!~
@926 = ~No more than this? Veldrin, why have we not done so already? Let us go at once!~
@927 = ~(Phaere nods in approval of Tsujatha's words, but she awaits your response.)~
@928 = ~This shark-thing ruler is clearly mad. Is there no way we could destroy all these miserable fish?~
@929 = ~We need do nothing then; they will breed themselves out of their own stupidity. It is perfect. Let us leave them to it, <CHARNAME>.~
@930 = ~Of course he would. It is the most foolish, obstinate course.~
@931 = ~(Tsujatha says nothing, but the glow of his silver eyes expresses his pleasure at this double deception.)~
@932 = ~Your honor remains untarnished, Lady Fentan, and you followed its demands aright.~
@933 = ~Well fought, Lady Fentan! Your sword arm is worthy of your heart.~
@934 = ~(Tsujatha shrugs.) It is best so. You know yourself, <CHARNAME>, that such poor excuses for mages ought to be killed, if only to protect other lives. Their own are, obviously, worthless.~
@935 = ~(Teos is clearly unmoved by the deaths of your apprentices, but he looks to you for your reaction.)~
@936 = ~Tsujatha, there is something wrong with you.~
@937 = ~I shall have to do something about it, I suppose.~
@938 = ~(You look upon Tsujatha, and you know you must do something about him.)~
@939 = ~What do you know of it, stranger?!~
@940 = ~Thank you, Tsujatha.~
@941 = ~My darling love.~
@942 = ~(The words are magically whispered in your ear, though you know Tsujatha is at the other end of the group from you.)~
@943 = ~I am ever with you, even when we are parted.~
@944 = ~(Tsujatha takes your hand and reverently puts it to his lips.) My goddess.~
@945 = ~(Tsujatha has claimed the place behind you, and suddenly you feel his breath sweetly warm on your skin as he wordlessly kisses the nape of your neck.)~
@946 = ~My Lady-love, you are the light of my eyes.~
@947 = ~I am afraid, my Lady, that I will one day wake and discover you have been only a dream. Until then, though, I will hold fast to the delights I do not deserve.~
@948 = ~(And Tsujatha takes you into his arms, covering your mouth with burning kisses.)~
@949 = ~<CHARNAME>? Are you well? Let me take your arm.~
@950 = ~You ought not to walk unaided for a time.~
@951 = ~Thank you, Tsujatha.~
@952 = ~I am fine, Tsujatha, just a bit dizzy. I don't need any help.~
@953 = ~I am honored to aid you. Rest assured, <CHARNAME>, that you are not alone in this.~
@954 = ~If you do need aid, do not hesitate to tell me, <CHARNAME>. Please.~
@955 = ~My Lady? Rest here in my arms for the moment. What is wrong?~
@956 = ~I felt myself slipping a bit, losing myself.~
@957 = ~I don't know what's wrong, but I am glad that you are here.~
@958 = ~I will eat the heart of that Irenicus for what he has done to you! (Tsujatha's hands stroke your hair as he continues.)~
@959 = ~I am here, beloved, and all my strength is yours.~
@960 = ~My <CHARNAME>. Please. Let me aid you now.~
@961 = ~I am here, beloved, no matter what may come, and all my strength is yours.~
@962 = ~I will never be parted from you, my Lady, and all my strength is yours.~
@963 = ~But, oh the vengeance I will have for your wrongs!~
@964 = ~Are you well, my Lady? You seem pale.~
@965 = ~Run, Tsujatha!~
@966 = ~I'm losing control of myself, Tsujatha!~
@967 = ~Don't leave me!~
@968 = ~No, beloved. I will stay by your side, come what may.~
@969 = ~Oh no. Why must it happen to *you*?~
@970 = ~I will not, my love. I am here.~
@971 = ~<CHARNAME>? What is wrong?~
@972 = ~Help me!~
@973 = ~Why--no. Not to *her*!~
@974 = ~I see your mouth move, but I cannot hear your words. <CHARNAME>--~
@975 = ~<CHARNAME>! By Kresek, not again! Not to *her*!~
