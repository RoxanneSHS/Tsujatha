  <p><a NAME="install"><b>I. INSTALLATION</b>
  <ol>
    <li TYPE="i">To install the Tsujatha Mod, first download the zip file. Open the zip file and extract all the files inside, which will be two (the .exe, and the folder containing everything else). Drop all these into your BGII - SoA folder. Then click the .exe and install Tsujatha. That's it. TOB is required to play.
  </ol>

  <p>Though this mod is made using the WeiDU standard, and *should* be
  compatible with all other WeiDU-based mods, there is always the possibility
  for conflicts.&nbsp;We suggest you install this mod AFTER the official
  patches, Baldurdash, and TeamBG mods.&nbsp;If you encounter any problems installing the mod, please visit our forums.
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="uninstall"><b>II. UNINSTALLATION</b>
  <p>Uninstalling is simple. Double-click the setup-Tsujatha.exe file and enter the
    given commands for Uninstallation.<br>
  Afterwards, you may delete the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>setup-Tsujatha.exe
    <li>setup-Tsujatha.tp2
    <li>setup-Tsujatha.debug
    <li>and the contents of the &quot;Tsujatha&quot; subfolder
  </ul>

  <p></a><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>
  <p><a NAME="compat"><b>III. COMPATIBILITY</b>

  <p>1. Tsujatha has been tested with Unfinished Business, Item Upgrades, NPC Flirt Pack, Banter Pack, Kelsey, Ninafer, Ghareth, Hubelpot, CRSoA, Solaufein, and Dungeon-Be-Gone.  So far, no problems there.  <br>
2. He is a WeiDU mod, so he should be compatible with most other WeiDU mods.  <br>
3. He will not concurrently romance. <br>
4. He DOES have variable checks for several non-Bioware NPC romances.  <br>
5. If you are a modder and want to give me your code, I will script in that check to prevent concurrent romancing.<br>
6. Some problems have been reported with the Multi-romancing component of EoU.  Concurrent romancing is not supported, so there is not much I can do.    <br>


<p>Solaufein note:<br>
Romance priority is given to Solaufein. Tsujatha has no way to object to Solaufein's romance, but if you advance too far with Solaufein, Tsujatha's romance will be screwed without warning. <br>

  <b>V. <a NAME="general">GENERAL OVERVIEW</a></b><a NAME="general">  </a>
  <p><b>**WARNING**<br>
This mod does contain mature content and adult situations.  You have been warned.</b>
  <p>Tsujatha is not a native of Faerun, nor has he ever been there before. You will find that he will not recognize certain Faerun races, and his reactions to them are not quite what one would expect. Tsujatha is a necromancer, and his level is not dependent upon yours when you pick him up. I would, therefore, recommend that you pick him up as early as possible in order to keep him in line with your party. He is an accomplished adventurer, however, so his level is not *too* low. He can be picked up just inside the Planar Sphere. He will approach you and initiate dialogue.

	 
  <p><a HREF="#top">Back to top</a>

  <p><a NAME="spoilers"><b>VI. SPOILERS</b></a>
  <p>1. Tsujatha has some potentially lethal conflicts with some of the Bioware NPCs. <br>
2. Tsujatha is extremely proud.  Be careful about insulting him if you want to keep him in your party.<br>
3. Do not expect "lovers' quarrels" with Tsujatha.  He is above that.  He is, however, proud and possessive.<br>
4. Though evil, he will romance only good females of the human, elven, or half-elven races.<br>
5. He will not leave your party if your reputation gets too high. <br>
6. If you kick him out of your party, he is gone forever.  You cannot drop him off and pick him up.<br>

  <p><a NAME="credit"><b>VIII. CREDITS</b></a>
  <p>Sillara the creator of Tsujatha.
  <p>Firstly, the voicing was done by Notmrt. Thank you!!!!
<p>An enormous "Thank you" must go out to Twinblades2 and Keryvian for scripting and bug-squashing, respectively.  It is not too much to say that without Twinblades2's excellent scripting techniques, Tsujatha would not have been released, and Keryvian's bug-hunting has ensured that, once released, Tsujatha would actually be playable!  In addition, special thanks to Grim Squeaker for helping to clean up the dialogue files, to Grog for his excellent explanations, and to Kismet and dorotea for romance-specific coding help. Thank you to SConrad for introducing me to InfExp and for voicing explanations. Thank you to Laufey, dorotea, and Nebukad for helping with the notorious unhappiness departure. And thanks to the bigg, Beyshaliban, and egrevyn!  Thank you to Immortality and Sidhe for the Tsujatha portraits and to Sol Ek Sa for the Sillara one.  Everyone at Chosen of Mystra, Gibberlings 3, Pocket Plane Group, and Forgotten Wars: Thanks a bunch!


<p>Translations:<br>
The German translation was done by Iscariot, and the Spanish one by Clan Dlan, specifically, Calamity, Chocobo_tyrael, Saemon, Immortality, Julio, Judas, Tux, Warlock,Fernandisco, and Nightcrawler.<br>
French translation thanks to La Voix 2 la Sagesse, Egrevyn and DarkWintermoon (of the d'Oghmatiques).<br>
Russian translation thanks to <br>

  <p>Notes on the Poetry:<br>
In this mod, you have the opportunity to quote poetry for Tsujatha, and, on occasion, he quotes it to you. (Don't worry.  You do not have another brooding poet Solaufein!)  The poems quoted in the mod are:<br>
Lines from "The Tempest" and "As You Like It."   <br>
Ben Jonson "To Celia" <br>
Andrew Marvell "To His Coy Mistress"<br>
Lord Byron "She Walks in Beauty"        <br>
William Shakespeare Sonnet 87, 91, 29, 90, 147<br>


<p>Note on LoveTalk music: <br>
1st Gymnopedie by Erik Satie<br>

<p>Thanks everyone, and I hope you enjoy Tsujatha.
